    "abstract": "This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK 754, an AAV8 based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon optimized and CpG depleted B domain deletedF8transgene under the control of a liver specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0x1012TAK 754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK 754 (3.1x1012CP/kg) mediated long term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK 754 ranging between 1.9x1012and 5.0x1013CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK 754 dose occurred without TAK 754 related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK 754.\n\nKeywords:hemophilia A, gene therapy, adeno associated virus, AAV, FVIII, biodistribution, safety, vector integration, vector immunogenicity",
    "methods": "For candidate screening, codon optimized cDNAs encoding the amino acid sequence identical to recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa type BDD FVIII31were used to generate AAV expression cassettes that were composed of flanking AAV2 derived ITRs, a liver specific TTR promoter/enhancer,60the respectiveBDD F8transgene, and a synthetic polyadenylation site.61Recombinant ssAAV8 vectors were produced in suspension HEK293 cells using a triple plasmid transfection protocol as described.62Titers of AAV vectors were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or ELISA, reported in vg/mL or CP/mL, respectively.\n\nVector genomes were quantified by qPCR targeting the AAV2 ITR sequence as described.63Sample preparation prior to PCR included treatment of vector solutions with DNAseI, followed by a Proteinase K step to release the AAV genome from the capsid. A final restriction enzyme digest with SmaI was performed to resolve AAV ITR T shape structures.\n\nThe commercially available ELISA (Progen AAV8 titration ELISA kit) contains a monoclonal antibody (ADK8) specific for a conformational epitope on assembled AAV8 capsids. The AAV8 capsid concentration was determined photometrically using plate immobilized biotinylated anti AAV8 antibodies.\n\nThe integrity of the vg was analyzed by AAV agarose gel electrophoresis performed as described.64Briefly, 1.5x1010vg/lane were electrophoresed in agarose gels, which were then stained in 2x GelRed solution (Biotium) and imaged.\n\nSDS PAGE followed by silver staining was performed according to standard procedures. Each lane contained 1.0x1010vg of the respective viral construct and was separated on a 4% 12% Bis Tris gel (NuPAGE Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Silver staining was performed with a SilverQuest kit (Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the relevant authorities on animal experiments and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The experiments were performed with male mice only. Three different strains were used: hemostatically normal C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories) for the Good Laboratory Practice toxicity study according to International Conference on Harmonization S6, FVIII KO mice (B6; 129S4 F8tm2Kaz; E17 KO)65for short term biopotency and efficacy studies, where animals with an immune response against the human FVIII xenoprotein were excluded from further evaluation, and hFVIII transgenic mice28for the long term expression study. In the latter strain, the murineF8gene is knocked out, but it also expresses human FVIII mRNA transcripts in multiple tissues from transgenic humanF8cDNA while lacking detectable circulating FVIII protein.\n\nTAK 754 was administered with 0.01% human serum albumin to mice aged 8 11weeks via manual injection into the lateral caudal vein (tail). A dose volume of 10mL/kg was used, and individual dose volumes were based on the individual body weight. An infusion rate of approximately 2mL/min was used.\n\nImmediately prior to blood collection, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane. We collected 250 uL blood samples via puncture of the retro orbital plexus. At the end of the in life phase, an additional and terminal cardiac blood sample (0.8mL) was collected from anesthetized animals. All blood samples were collected directly in citrate anticoagulants and processed by centrifugation within 15min.\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) or total RNA was extracted from mouse livers using the DNeasy Blood& Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol for animal tissues. gDNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (1ug) was treated with DNase (TURBO DNA free Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).F8 transgene copy numbers in both gDNA and cDNA samples were determined by qPCR. The nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe used are the following: forward primer 5 TCATGGACACCCTGCCT 3; reverse primer 5 GAGAAGTGGATGGAGTGAATGT 3; probe 5 6 FAM ACCTGCTTTCTATGGGCTCCAATGAG MGB 3. PCR reactions were carried out on the QuantStudio 7 Flex PCR platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR data analysis was performed using the specific device's software that automatically calculates theF8copies per reaction based on the linear regression parameters of the standard curve.\n\nFVIII activity in plasma was determined using a commercial FVIII chromogenic assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (COATEST SP4 FVIII; catalog no. 82409463, Chromagenix). Results are given in IU FVIII/mL, derived from a reference curve generated with an in house FVIII reference, calibrated against the World Health Organization standard.\n\nHuman FVIII antigen levels in mouse plasma were analyzed by commercial ELISA (Asserachrom VIII:Ag Kit; Diagnostica Stago) per the manufacturer's manual.\n\nThe efficacy of TAK 754 was determined by measuring the total blood loss in mice,66whereby animals were anesthetized (100mg/kg ketamine and 10mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and 2mm of the tail tip was cut off. Blood was collected over an observation period of 60min; blood loss was measured gravimetrically.\n\nTAK 754 biopotency was assessedinvitrousing the human hepatic cell line HepG2.46After treatment of cells with 2mM hydroxyurea for 22 h, the cells were infected with AAV8 FVIII vectors in F17 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10ug/mL von Willebrand factor (Baxalta) and 5uM 5 (N ethyl N isopropyl) Amiloride (Sigma). During incubation (96 h), FVIII was expressed and released into the cell supernatant. FVIII activity was determined by chromogenic endpoint measurement, as described for theinvivoFVIII biopotency assay.A reference curve of AAV8 FVIII vector material was based on AAV8 ELISA titer.\n\nThe analysis was based on the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.67Briefly, the test sample was mixed with a test base (containing BDD rFVIII), and the loss in FVIII activity upon incubation was measured. The relative loss in activity is correlated to the inhibitor concentration in the sample; results are reported in Bethesda units per milliliter.\n\nAssessment of toxicity was based on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, and clinical and anatomic pathology evaluations. Complete necropsies were performed on five animals from each cohort, with macroscopic abnormalities for all tissues, organ weights, and microscopic examinations recorded. Tissues were collected for biodistribution assessment from a further five animals from each cohort. Blood was collected pre dose and at necropsy (n= 5) for FVIII activity, FVIII Ag, binding anti BDD FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti BDD FVIII antibodies, and binding anti AAV8 antibodies.\n\nWe used 25mg of AAV treated liver tissues for fully automated DNA isolation using Qiagen spin columns on the QIAcube robotic system. Vector copy numbers were determined by vector specific qPCR. ISs were analyzed using (nr) and standard LAM PCR,68which identifies genomic sequences flanking the integrated AAV vector DNA. (nr)LAM PCR amplicons were sequenced after sample preparation on a MiSeq instrument. Data were processed by (semi ) automated bioinformatics data mining.\n\nGraphs and statistical analyses were created with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Student's t test, one way or two way ANOVA, followed by Holm Sidak post hoc test was used for the statistical analysis as appropriate. Values are presented as the mean+/  SEM, andp<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",
    "results": "Expression levels of endogenous wild type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon optimizedBDD F8open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure1A). A total of 41 codon optimized ssAAV8.BDD FVIII vectors (sequences 01 41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WTF8nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of thisinvivobiopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WTF8(GenBank:M14113) and 74 fold improved efficacy (Figure1B). The guanine cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (FigureS1;TableS1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (FigureS2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIopt seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIopt seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6 fold higher than for the otherwise identicalF8WT nucleotide sequence vector,25indicating that vector production using theF8lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (FigureS1).\n\nCandidate screening of AAV8.BDD FVIIIopt\n\n(A) Schematic drawing of the AAV cassette for expression of codon optimized B domain deletedF8cDNAs (BDD F8co), including the liver specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter/enhancer, a synthetic polyadenylation signal (poly (A)), and flanking AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs).

The nucleotide sequence with the best performance (seq04) is indicated by a black arrowhead and that of the WT control by a gray arrowhead. Data shown represent the mean +/  standard error of the mean (SEM). (C) Agarose gel analysis of the DNA payload of ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIopt seq4. Note the single band with the expected size of 5.2 kb. (D) SDS PAGE of ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIopt seq4. The capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 appear as main proteins in the silver stained gel.\n\nThese favorable features provided the rationale to select ssAAV8.BDD FVIIIopt seq04 as the lead candidate for the development of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector.\n\nIn anticipation of clinical trials of TAK 754 gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach, which was previously based on a qualified qPCR of vg with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We therefore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assaying AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the CP enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent preclinical development of TAK 754, as well as for clinical dosing in a phase 1/2 study.\n\nThe FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efficacy of TAK 754 was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of 3.0x1011, 1.2x1012, or 3.0x1012CP/kg. A preliminary safety assessment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested positive for anti FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of biopotency and efficacy. No treatment related findings were observed microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro  or macrovascular thrombosis or inflammatory infiltrate.\n\nAnimals that received 1.2x1012or 3.0x1012CP/kg showed a dose dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/mL over the investigation period (Figure2A). FVIII activity was undetectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of 3.0x1011CP/kg. Dose dependent activity of TAK 754 was confirmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (FigureS3).\n\nPotency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK 754\n\n(A)Invivobiopotency determination. FVIII KO mice (n= 12) were injected with 3.0x1011, 1.2x1012, and 3.0x1012CP/kg TAK 754 vector and analyzed for plasma FVIII activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in controls and the low dose group but showed a dose dependent increase in the mid  and high dose groups. Data are shown in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line. (B) Hemostatic efficacy testing. The same animals as under (A)were subjected to a tail tip bleeding assay on day 63. A dose dependent reduction of blood loss was observed for the higher doses. Note that only animals testing negative for anti FVIII antibodies on day 56 were tested. The median is indicated by a horizontal line. (C) Transduction efficiency.F8transgene copy numbers in gDNA (dark bars) and in cDNA (light bars) were quantified in TAK 754 treated animals and controls (n= 2) on day 63, confirming dose dependent liver transduction. Data are presented as the mean +/  standard deviation (SD).\n\nA tail tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype. Animals treated with buffer and TAK 754 at the lowest dose showed similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and 7.5mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII activity in these animals (Figure2B). The higher doses (1.2x1012or 3.0x1012CP/kg) of TAK 754 significantly reduced median blood loss to 0.6 and 0.4mg/g, respectively, in a dose dependent manner (p<0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose proportionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the low dose.\n\nAt the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantification of vg andF8RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group or the low dose TAK 754 group were under the detection limit of the applied method. Mid  and high dose animals showed robust and dose dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Figure2C).F8RNA levels were consistent withF8DNA levels, except for two low dose animals showing a measurableF8transcript signal (i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5 fold dose increase from 1.2x1012to 3.0x1012CP/kg resulted in a 3.9 fold increase inF8gDNA levels and a 3.1 fold increase inF8RNA levels (Figure2C), which broadly mirrored the 3.2 fold increase in FVIII activity levels (Figure2A).\n\nThe development of an antibody response directed against the human FVIII xenoprotein capable of neutralizing FVIII activity is a well known phenomenon in mice.27To enable a long term expression study following the delivery of TAK 754, we employed a transgenic mouse model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually shows immunological tolerance toward the human coagulation factor.28huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK 754 dose of 3.1x1012CP/kg and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti drug antibodies from 2 to 24weeks. The mean FVIII plasma activity ranged between 2.9 and 3.8 IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure3A). Three of 30 animals tested positive for anti BDD FVIII immunoglobulin binding antibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent binding antibodies positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment related clinical symptoms or deaths were recorded.\n\nSustained FVIII expression following a single injection of TAK 754\n\n(A) Long term FVIII expression in a transgenic human FVIII mouse model. Following delivery of 3.1x1012CP/kg of TAK 754 to huFVIII tg mice (n= 30), activity levels were stable between 2 and 24weeks. Data are presented in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B) Vector biodistribution. Wild type C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a TAK 754 dose of 9.5x1012CP/kg, and vector biodistribution was determined at three time points, including 3days, 3weeks, and 18weeks (n= 20). Data are given in mean+/  SEM; values <LLOQ were included as zero.\n\nThe toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK 754 was examined in cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK 754 at 2.0x1012, 3.8x1012, and 9.5x1012CP/kg, and also at higher dose levels up to 5.0x1013CP/kg (1.0x1013, 3.0x1013, and 5.0x1013CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the TAK 754 activity data shown inFigure2A. The design of the toxicity study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses thatincluded complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, biodistribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti BDD FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti BDD FVIII antibodies, and binding anti AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18.\n\nDuring the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attributed to TAK 754 during the in life phase, pathology, post dosing observations, or any adverse TAK 754 related changes in clinical chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or urinalysis.\n\nThe distribution of TAK 754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose levels tested. TAK 754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing by day 21 (Figure3B). However, TAK 754 DNA levels were still highest in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK 754 DNA levels in brain and testes samples harvested from TAK 754 treated animals were evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantification by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the 9.5x1012CP/kg dose group (Figure3B).\n\nAnimals treated with TAK 754 had measurable amounts of human FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concentrations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation of circulating anti human BDD FVIII binding antibodies, which can compete with the species specific assay, resulting in nondetectable FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic analysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high level AAV FVIII protein expression.29\n\nTAK 754 treated animals also showed higher FVIII activity levels compared with the pre treatment period, indicating that BDD FVIII was expressed in these mice. However, some animals had even lower than normal FVIII levels most likely caused by the generation of neutralizing anti human BDD FVIII antibodies that inhibited both human BDD FVIII activity and endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of the antibodies' partial cross reactivity against mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against BDD FVIII became measurable by week 18 in all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals tested strongly positive for anti AAV8 binding antibodies from week 3.\n\nIn summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intravenous (i.v.) TAK 754 injections at doses up to 5.0x1013CP/kg found no evidence of TAK 754 related adverse effects during the in life phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no observed adverse effect level was 5.0x1013cp/kg, the highest dose tested.\n\nWhile host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of the TAK 754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either 2.0x1012or 1.0x1013CP/kg TAK 754 and observed for 1 or 4months (Figure4). Liver transduction levels, determined byF8qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points (FigureS4).\n\nVector integration site analysis\n\nCumulative retrieval frequencies of top 10 cell clones in the livers of mice following injection of TAK 754 at (A) 2.0x1012or (B) 1.0x1013CP/kg. Samples with ID 1 4 and 10 13 were analyzed 1month after treatment, those with ID 5 9 and 14 18 four months after treatment.\n\nIllumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear amplification mediated (LAM) PCR products showed comparable numbers of average sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration (TableS2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected in animals in both groups at 1month after gene therapy treatment (5 54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5 42 unique ISs/mice), confirming an integration frequency of <=0.01% (TableS2).\n\nThe detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1month after treatment and 3 ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM PCRs after 4months (Figure4). This indicates that the unequal IS frequency profiles are due to the low number of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low order (<=4) common ISs could be identified at both time points, which is in line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of TAK 754, correlating with an untargeted integration profile. None of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30\n\nIn summary, the integration profile of TAK 754 in FVIII KO mouse liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4 month observation period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.",
    "discussion": "Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK 754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31While the vector was designed and developed at a time before first clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became available, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efficient expression of the humanF8transgene in humans.\n\nChoice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efficiency of hepatocytes in preclinical models32and a number of liver directed clinical gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid serotype.33Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species dependent performance of vector capsids.34It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20 fold lower efficiency.35This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0x1012CP/kg TAK 754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0x1012CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of 6% of normal.\n\nIt is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8 vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36Consistently, we found that TAK 754's vg was the correct size and intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of similarly oversized BDD FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537and AAVrh838led to aberrant, truncated genomes that first had to be re assembled in transduced cells through recombination before functional FVIII could have been produced.\n\nThe use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer combination enabled robust liver specific gene expression. This promoter was selected from a variety of liver specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539and came off well in a head to head comparison with other commonly used liver specific promoters.40The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK 754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX33518and SPK 8011,41although in the latter case, a point mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one.\n\nCodon optimization of theBDD F8transgene initially relied on available codon optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content.42However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44TAK 754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon optimizedF8sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters.45The lead candidateF8nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74 fold increased expression in FVIII KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (FiguresS2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13has not been carried out (FigureS2B).\n\nOverall, the vector showed a good efficacy and safety profile. Dose dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after single i.v. injections of TAK 754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed variability of FVIII expression (Figure2A) appears to be a transgene specific phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter species variability,46that of BDD FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter individual variability of AAV5 hFVIII SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host mediated factors could contribute.47,48Future endeavors to identify predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of approaches with optimized outcomes of AAV basedF8gene therapies.\n\nA TAK 754 mediated dose response of FVIII activity was confirmed in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such aninvitroassay could allow replacement of the cumbersomeinvivolot release testing procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the authorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49\n\nDose dependent efficacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in FVIII KO mice, and long term expression could be demonstrated in a separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a single dose of 4x1012CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week 2 until the end of the experiment (6months), with no trend for a decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti human FVIII antibody formation,28served its purpose to monitor TAK 754 dependent long term expression of human BDD FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK 754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent from typical preclinical animal models.\n\nNo toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK 754 were observed. Single bolus injections of TAK 754 administered to mice at doses of up to 5x1013CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs, or post dosing observations related to TAK 754. A limitation of the mouse safety study was its duration of 18weeks, which precluded the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later than 1 year.50\n\nThe observed biodistribution of TAK 754 in treated FVIII KO mice confirmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue, with minimal off target gene expression in other tissues, consistent with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical limitations of (nr)LAM PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector integration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4 month observation period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK 754 will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to patients, caution is needed since HCC relevant loci are not well conserved between mice and humans,30and the duration of the study was too short to observe any HCC concerns.\n\nThe preclinical development program showed a good efficacy and safety profile for TAK 754 and formed the basis for defining the starting dose of 2.0x1012CP/kg, factoring in the above mentioned mouse to human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these promising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more critical than in rodents or NHPs.51A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK 754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8 based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03370172) showed dose dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0x1012CP/kg [n= 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0x1012CP/kg [n= 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the peripheral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory anti FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune response.53\n\nIt is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent species were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate in monkey populations.54,55Since an AAV vector induced immune response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression has not been observed in NHPs,56such a study would also likely have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK 754 vector already in preclinical stage.\n\nA comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table1) suggests that rather subtle yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine the success or failure of a therapy.13Several AAV based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered onClinicalTrials.govalso counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head to head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross reactivity of anti AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.\n\nCharacteristics of hemophilia A clinical stage AAV gene therapy vectors\n\nApoE/A1AT, apolipoprotein E/alpha 1 antitrypsin; HCB, hepatic combinatorial bundle; HLP, hybrid liver specific promoter; HNF3, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3; TTRm, mutated transthyretin.\n\nReference31, BDD hFVIII, with 14 amino acid SQ linker (moroctocog alfa).\n\nPatent US9447168B2.\n\nReference41.\n\nPatent US20240066146A1.\n\nPorcine human BDD FVIII hybrid protein.\n\nPatent US10888628B2.\n\nReference9, BDD hFVIII, with 17 amino acid peptide insertion comprising 6 N linked glycosylation motifs.\n\nReference11.\n\nWith regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on liver specific promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcription.41The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression.
