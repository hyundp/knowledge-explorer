    "abstract": "To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth's surface, we flew NASA's C 20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera wereMycobacteriumandAchromobacterat 10,000 ft;StenotrophomonasandAchromobacterat 20,000 ft;DelftiaandPseudoperonosporaat 30,000 ft; andAlcaligenesandPenicilliumat 40,000 ft. Culture based detections also identified viableBacillus zhangzhouensis,Bacillus pumilus, andBacillusspp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7 day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measuredmeteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor global bioaerosol emissions and impacts.\n\nSubject terms:Biological techniques, Microbiology, Environmental sciences",
    "methods": "Two research flights (Fig.1) were flown over the Sierra Nevada mountains (Supplementary Fig.S1) across California using NASA's C 20A Gulfstream III aircraft available through the Airborne Science Program at Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC). The first flight was 2.9h total flown on June 20, 2018; the second flight was 3.5h total on June 21, 2018. During each daytime flight, the aircraft ascended to 40,000 ft and remained at this altitude for 30 40min sampling air at an estimated rate of 8.5 Lmin 1. Then, in a \"staircase\" pattern, the aircraft descended in 10,000 ft increments from 30,000 ft, to 20,000 ft, to 10,000 ft, for 30 40min of air sampling at each altitude step. Supplementary TableS1summarizes sampling times and other pertinent flight information. Aircraft telemetry data was visualized using Google Earth Pro software with images from Landsat and Copernicus to generate terrain (Supplementary Fig.S1).\n\nSampling over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range. (a) Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) onboard NASA's C 20A aircraft. Air sampling line, flow valve, cascade impactor, and air flow meter shown on workbench; (b) June 20, 2018, view from C 20A window at lowest altitude sampled (10,000 ft) above the US Sierra Nevada mountain range with an aerosol haze visible on the horizon; (c) Flight pattern on June 20, 2018 based on GPS data, sampling for 30 40min at 10,000 ft steps up to 40,000 ft; (d) Flight pattern on June 21, 2018 based on GPS data, sampling for 30 40min starting at 40,000 ft and stepping down in 10,000 ft steps. Panels C and D were generated using Mathworks Matlab software, versions R2018 to R2019 (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), from the recorded flight path.\n\nSample collection procedures were carried out using the ABC hardware system as previously described2. Before the aircraft reached each sampling altitude, gamma irradiated (i.e., DNA treated) gelatinous filter membranes were loaded into a cascade impactor (Supplementary Fig.S2). Two different cascade impactor stages were used to size separate the bioaerosols (Product TE 10 860; Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH). Each sampler stage had 400 small, round, drilled orifices (1.18mm on first stage; 0.25mm on second stage). As described by Smith et al.2, the first stage should capture aerosols larger than 8um (if traveling into the inlet) while the second stage would capture smaller aerosols between 1 and 8um (nominal). The first stage holds Filter A and second stage holds Filter B. An upstream valve was used to regulate atmospheric air flowing into the system. With the air flow off, fresh filters were aseptically swapped into the sampling system before the next altitude was sampled. A total of 16 filter samples were collected at the four different altitudes on two consecutive flight days with two filters staged at each altitude.\n\nTo produce a baseline for assessing known system contaminants, we followed a previously described method2where pre flight and post flightground controlswere collected on the C 20A window plate, air probe inlet, and an exterior portion of the aircraft upstream of the sampling probe using a pre wetted, DNA free sterile applicator (Puritan cat #25 3306UTTFDNA). Swabs were stored in 5mL of sterile deionized water within a 15ml Falcon tube and kept at 4 degreesC until laboratory processing. To characterize contaminants inside the aircraft, a blank gelatinous filter was placed in a petri dish resting on the work bench and exposed to ambient aircraft cabin air during every filter exchange. These samples were reported ascabin controls. The surface of the bench holding the cascade sampler was also swabbed with a pre wetted, DNA free sterile applicator as an additionalcabin control.\n\nFor each sample, one filter half was archived in a  80 degreesC freezer (TSU 600A, Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC) and the other half was put in 40ml of warm (37 degreesC) molecular grade water which easily dissolved the gelatinous filter membrane. The sample was then concentrated using the InnovaPrep CP Select concentrating pipette (InnovaPrep, Drexel, MO). The concentrator passed the entire sample volume (40ml) through a 0.1um flat polyethersulfone membrane (part number CC08001), followed elution buffer (EB, phosphate buffering solution with 0.75% Tween 20 [PBST]) into a final output volume of 1mL. Filters A and B were processed separately. Similarly, swabs contained in 15mL tubes (wetted with 5ml of sterile water) from ground and cabin control samples were concentrated in 1mL of EB. For each concentrated volume, 200 uL was used for DNA extraction and subsequent metagenomic sequencing; 100 uL was used for culture based recovery assays; and 700uL was archived at  80 degreesC in the freezer in 20% glycerol stocks (final volume). We have included threeprocess controls. The first one is the whole blank gelatinous membrane filter that has gone through the entire InnovaPrep processing and DNA extraction; the other two are two replicates of the DNA extraction with no template controls. A total of 13 ground, cabin and process control samples were collected during the aircraft flight operations. Supplementary TableS2summarizes all experimental samples.\n\nA total volume of 200ul was utilized for DNA extraction from the 1mL InnovaPrep concentrated sample. Each sample was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep PowerViral DNA/RNA Kit (part number 28000, Hilden, Germany). Standard manufacturer's protocols with bead beating were followed to extract DNA from each sample. Samples were eluted in 60 uL of elution buffer and quantitated using the ThermoFisher Qubit Fluorometer (Waltham, MA). The average concentration of flight samples and controls was approximately 14.9pg/uL.\n\nThe Illumina NextSeq500 was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the Illumina NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair, paired end reads13. DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Illumina Nextera Flex DNA Library Preparation Kit (part number 20018705). For each sample, approximately 400pg was input into the kit and standard manufacturer protocols were followed. Quality, concentration, and fragment sizes of the completed libraries were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were normalized and pooled to 100 200pM according to the Agilent Tapestation determined concentrations. The pooled library sample was quantitated using the ThermoFisher Qubit fluorimeter and denaturing steps were performed according to the manufacturer's standard recommendations (Illumina). A concentration of 1% of Illumina's standard positive control (PhiX) was added to the pooled libraries and 1.3pM final library concentration was input into the Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument.\n\nMetagenomic sequences were analyzed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT), a metagenomic analysis pipeline that searches for taxonomic identifiers associated with k mers in reference genome databases14,15. The database contains distinct species level alignments for 4,863 bacteria; 4,189 viruses; 2,038 eukaryotes; and 279 archaea.\n\nSimilarity between samples was visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the t Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) methods. NMDS analysis was performed by Jaccard distance of detection, comparing microbial presence (above 1 LMAT read) and absence differences at the genus level between samples. tSNE of quantification matrices was used to reduce high dimensional data into a low dimensional space for visualization16. Through both data processing techniques, samples with high similarity will cluster together whereas less similar samples will be spaced further apart. Prior to tSNE analyses, the relative abundance of each taxon in a sample was transformed into Euclidian space using the center log ratio (clr) method in the ALDEx2 (v.1.16.0) R package17.\n\nAlpha diversity refers to the diversity within an ecosystem. It is usually expressed by the number of species (i.e., species richness) in that ecosystem. Alpha (alpha) diversity was estimated for each sample and compared within altitudes across flight days. We quantified alpha diversity using the Chao1 estimator18and the observed number of effective taxa (qNeff) weighted by each taxonomic proportion of DNA per sample19. Weights were chosen such thatqNeffcorresponded to the following transformations of commonly used diversity indices: observed richness (the number of taxa seen;0Neff), exponentiated Shannon index (both taxa richness and evenness;1Neff), and the reciprocal Simpson index (dominance and evenness of taxa;2Neff).\n\nA differential abundance analysis was performed for taxa at each altitude step using the ALDEx2 (v.1.16.0) R package17. Individual abundances for an identified taxon were transformed using the centered log ratio (clr) method17,20. Transformed counts were then analyzed for differential abundances across altitudes steps using the aldex.glm() function. Finally,Pvalues for taxa were corrected for multiple tests using the Benjamini and Hochberg method21.\n\nAfter sample concentration, 100 uL aliquots were spread onto Reasoner's 2A agar (R2A) plates and Trypticase soy agar (TSA) plates, wrapped in Parafilm (American National Can, Chicago, IL) and incubated in the dark at 25 degreesC for up to four weeks while monitoring signs of growth. Individual colonies were sub cultured on R2A until isolated, and then cryopreserved with 10% sterile glycerol (Amresco, Solon, OH) and nutrient broth (Difco, Sparks, MD) at  80 degreesC. Bacterial colonies DNA extraction and 16S rRNA Sanger sequencing was done by GENEWIZ (South Planfield, NJ). Forward and reverse 16S rRNA sequences were merged and searched against the NCBI non redundant database using BLASTn22.\n\nHYSPLIT back trajectories23were obtained using reanalysis data on the READY website,https://www.ready.noaa.gov. Heights at the different sampling altitudes were used as input for starting points in the model.\n\nAtmospheric microbes are co transported in aerosols that have a wide range of sizes24,25. We forecasted aerosol (forward) dispersal from the sampled locations using several modeling process assumptions. Since the typical lifetime of relatively small particles in the upper troposphere (e.g., 10days for 9um particles26) is comparable to the analysis timescale of one week, our analysis does not require a detailed particle size distribution. First, the bioaerosols were assumed to be 1 um aerodynamic diameter particles released at a constant rate along the sampling flight path. Our choice of a spatially and temporally uniform particle concentration matches the sampling resolution within the flight path. Second, the downwind time integrated concentration of the released material was predicted using the Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (DOE LLNL NARAC) modeling system. Atmospheric Data Assimilation and Parameterization Techniques (ADAPT) / Lagrangian Operational Dispersion Integrator (LODI) models. The ADAPT model was initialized with 0.25deg resolution Global Forecast Model fields27,28. Our modeling resolved North American near surface influences up to seven days after flights with a 30.8km horizontal resolution. Default ADAPT upper tropospheric dispersion parameters were used: 0.01 m2s 1and 0.25 m2s 2for the vertical eddy diffusivity (Kz) and horizontal velocity variance (u2=v2), respectively, and, while reasonable for many situations, may underestimate the overall vertical atmospheric mixing during the seven day period. Non precipitation atmospheric removal processes were accounted for by including both (a) gravitational settling and (b) an additional 0.003ms 1deposition velocity. We chose the latter value to reflect deposition to regions with significant vegetation29. In order to simplify the modeling effort, other known effects on aerosol lifetimes in the atmosphere, including highly convective conditions and additional emissions from the Earth's surface were not considered. Finally, to make our forecasts more relevant to downwind human population centers, we estimated the \"average\" outdoor individual and population level exposures. The individual exposure probability was calculated by multiplying (a) predicted near surface outdoor aerosol concentrations by (b) an average adult breathing rate (respiratory second volume) of 2x10 4m3s 130. The population level exposure estimate was calculated by multiplying the individual exposure estimate by the population as reported in the LandScan 2015 High Resolution Global Population Database31.",
    "results": "Approximately 10M reads were obtained for each flight sample. After LMAT analysis, which combines forward and reverse reads into a single unit, an average of 5M reads per sample were uniquely assigned to a taxonomic identifier at the given score threshold14,15. On average, 940,000 reads per sample corresponded to microbial sequences, out of which 613,000 reads were assigned at the genus level. The detailed number of reads for each flight and control sample is listed in Supplementary TableS2. Two statistical methods were used to visualize sample clustering: NMDS and tSNE. Neither of the two data visualization approaches showed clear clustering of flight samples by altitude (Fig.2). Colored circles represent flight samples from each altitude. Four samples from each altitude were included: filters A and B from Day 1 and filters A and B from Day 2. Three cabin air control, three process control and six ground control samples were included in both data visualization methods to help determine if atmospheric samples were significantly different from the controls. Jaccard distance (Fig.2a) showed a tighter grouping of the flight samples based on altitude, but overlap patterns suggested a high amount of similarity between sampling at different heights. Most of the control samples clustered together by NMDS visualization (Fig.2a); tSNE also showed majority of controls separated from flight samples (Fig.2b).\n\nVisualization of sample clustering using multiple distance and similarity metrics.

Six ground controls (pre flight and post flight swabs), along with four data points from each altitude (Filters A (alpha) and B (beta); both flight days) were included in the diversity comparison. No significant differences between samples were observed using a Kruskall Wallis one way ANOVA of species richness, nor Shannon and Simpson indices. Further pairwise comparisons of ground, 10,000 ft and 30,000 ft groups using the Mann Whitney and Student's t tests found no significant difference between the groups either. The Simpson index comparison at the genus level resulted in the smallestpvalue of 0.078.\n\nAlpha (alpha) diversity for flight and ground samples at genus level resolution. alpha diversity quantified as1Neffwith samples shown as circles. The area of each circle is proportional to the number of genus resolved fragments in a sample. Violin plots show density of alpha diversity, box plots show the first, second and third quartiles, and 1.5 times the interquartile range of each time point's alpha diversity sample distribution. Dark red diamonds represent the means. The figure was generated in R (v.3.6.0)53using package ggplot2 (v.3.2.1)54.\n\nProportionally abundant microbial taxa from each flight day are depicted for Filter A (Fig.4) and Filter B (Supplementary Fig.S4). The 12 most abundant genera in Filter A (from either day) wereAchromobacter, Alcaligenes, Delftia, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Mycobacterium, Penicillium, Prevotella, Pseudoperonospora, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus, Tetrahymena,andVeillonella.. Detected as proportionally abundant in both days wereAchromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus,andDelftia.On June 20, 2018,Lachnoanaerobaculum,Alcaligenes, Mycobacterium,Tetrahymena,andVeillonellaappeared, whereasPenicillium, Prevotella, Pseudoperonospora,andPorphyromonaswere only abundant on June 21, 2018. In addition to microbial taxa,Pinus koraiensisandPinus radiatawere also detected as proportionally abundant at 10,000 ft but only on the second flight day (June 21, 2018). Species level abundance of Filter A is depicted in Supplementary Fig.S5,Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Alcaligenes faecalis,Bradyrhizobiumsp. DFCI 1,Delftia acidovorans,Delftiasp.

The top 12 most abundant genera in Filter B includedAchromobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Byssochlamys, Chryseobacterium, Delftia, Enterobacter, Gardnerella, Meiothermus, Penicillium, Prevotella, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus(Supplementary Fig.S3).\n\nRelative abundance of genera across altitudes on both sampling days. Samples from Filter A separated by day and collection altitude to examine shifts in relative abundance of genera.Achromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus,andDelftiawere among the top 12 most abundant taxa in both days.Bacterial genera that were not among the top 12 represented by light gray colored bars. In additional to bacterial and fungal taxa shown,Pinus koraiensisandPinus radiatawere also detected at 10,000 ft on the second flight day (June 21, 2018) but were not plotted for clarity. The figure was generated in R (v.3.6.0)53using package ggplot2 (v.3.2.1)54.\n\nIn the experimental controls (Supplementary Fig.S6), the most abundant detected species or plasmids wereAchromobacter xylosoxidans,Acidovorox sp.JS42 plasmid pAOVO01,Alicycliphilus denitrificans,Aspergillus oryzae,Aureobasidium pullulans,Bradyrhizobiumsp. DFCI 1,Capnocytophaga sp.oral taxon 326, Eimeria mitis,Eimeria praecox,Haemophilus parainfluenzae,Neosartorya fischeri, andPrevotella sp.ICM33.Achromobacter xylosoxidansandBradyrhizobiumsp. DFCI 1 were detected in both flight samples and control samples, suggesting the possibility of contamination associated with those reads.\n\nTable1shows the taxonomic distinctions between samples, summarizing the five most abundant genera from each altitude and controls (depicting only Filter A samples for clarity). At 10,000 ft, the distribution of the top five genera was even (with abundances ranging from 30 to 9% on June 20, 2018; and 53% to 4% on June 21, 2018). At 40,000 ft, the top five taxa were dominated by a single genus (e.g.,Alcaligenes97% on June 20, 2018;Penicillium82% on June 21, 2018). The altitude where the taxonomic composition was most similar between the two days sampled was 30,000 ft where bothDelftiaandStreptococcuswere proportionally abundant.\n\nTop five most abundant genera at each altitude compared to pre flight ground controls.\n\nIsolated bacterial colonies were identified by searching 16S Sanger sequences against the NCBI non redundant database using BLASTn22. Table2summarizes the isolates.Bacilluswas the most prevalent genus identified, measured in 25% of flight samples and all control samples.StreptococcusandStreptomyceswere also identified from a 40,000 ft sample. Other bacteria found in controls were:Lysinibacillus sinduriensis,Methylorubrum zatmanii,Lysinibacillus sphaericus,Lysinibacillus acetophenoni,Pseudomonas syringae,Microvirgasp.,Methylorubrum populi, andCellulomonas cellasea.\n\nViable microorganisms recovered from flight and control samples.\n\n*The number in brackets indicates number of isolates matching the genus and/or species.\n\n#Designates query lengths<1,000 nt.\n\n$Query sequence had <95% identity to database match.\n\n+Isolates from June 20, 2018 sampling only.\n\n^Isolates from June 21, 2018 sampling only.\n\n&Control sample taken in lab July 2018.\n\nGenerally, the air sampled on each flight day shared a similar transport history off the coast of N. America. Supplementary Fig.S7provides kinematic back trajectory modeling with Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT). We note that none of the trajectories above 10,000 ft approached the Earth's surface over the time period modeled. There were also clear differences in trajectories between samples at the same altitude separated by approximately 24h.\n\nSeparate, forward modeling of air masses showed that a portion of flight sampled bioaerosols, if undisturbed, could have exposed outdoor downwind populations over the next week (Fig.5). In this figure, the grey contours indicate the fraction of sampled material that would have been inhaled by an average outdoor person (individual exposure) had the material not been sampled (termed potential exposures). Darker colors indicate a larger potential exposure. Figure5a shows the sum of the potential exposures from all four samples (10,000 ft, 20,000 ft, 30,000 ft and 40,000 ft). Note that the exposure may not occur uniformly over the week period, but rather the exposure regions can change as the air mass travels downwind and is diluted, see Fig.5b,c. The predicted potential impact areas were highly dependent on altitude. For instance, most of the impacts in the first week were associated with air sampled at 10,000 ft while air sampled at 20,000 ft was associated with a small potential exposure region in NV (USA). No potential exposures were associated with the highest altitude samples (30,000 and 40,000 ft) during the first week. Overall, only a small fraction (3x10 8) of sampled particles would be expected to reach population centers across North America and be inhaled during the first week. The actual amount of material inhaled would be smaller than predicted here since (a) most people are indoors and (b) indoor individuals have lower exposure, relative to outdoor individuals, to outdoor origin airborne particulates32,33.\n\nAerosol dispersal predictions.

This image shows geographic distribution of potentially inhaled material (inhaled fraction of sample material per sq km). Panels were generated using Mathworks Matlab software, versions R2018 to R2019 (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), from the modelling described in the text. Underlying map data was provided by Google and INEGI and accessed through the Google Maps Platform API.",
    "discussion": "With an aerobiology study flown into the upper troposphere, we detected changing microbial abundance with height above the Earth's surface   our dataset was reliant upon a shotgun metagenomics approach analyzing samples acquired between 10,000 to 40,000 ft, on two consecutive summer days over the US Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. Controls were also sequenced as a baseline reference. This strategy was essential because contaminants can confuse signals from low biomass environments. We observed significant differences in microbial taxa from flight samples compared to control samples. The most abundant taxa identified in the flight samples were:Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Delftia, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Mycobacterium, Penicillium, Prevotella, Pseudoperonospora, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus, Tetrahymena,andVeillonella. Alcaligenesis a genus of gram negative, aerobic bacteria found mostly in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates, decaying materials, dairy products, water, and soil. It can cause opportunistic infections, including nosocomial sepsis.Alcaligenes faecalisis usually found in soil and water environments, and its abundance in atmospheric samples hints at a possible relationship with agriculture (e.g., wastewater, compost, feedlots34) considering the physical proximity of air sampled to the CA Central Valley with ~28,000 km2of irrigated farmlands. Up to 55% of dust deposition at alpine sites in the Sierra Nevada comes from the Central Valley35; thus, the air sampled in this study would be expected to contain agriculturally produced bioaerosols. The proportional abundance ofStenotrophomonas maltophiliaidentify it as another candidate to examine for possible emanation from the Central Valley, considering the species is regularly found in plant rhizospheres, animals, croplands, and water sources36. Other noteworthy bacterial standouts in our atmospheric samples part of the normal flora of the mouth and gastrointestinal tract in humans wereDelftia acidovorans37,Lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum38,Prevotella,VeillonellaandStreptococcus. Wastewater treatment facilities could be a contributing source of these bioaerosols39.Mycobacteriumwas among the most abundant genera at 10,000 ft on the first sampling day; aerosolized nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause pulmonary disease40, but we did not produce viability information with DNA based detections.Achromobacter xylosoxidansmay be the most clinically relevant species detected in our study (endogenous microbiota of the ear and gastrointestinal tract41); however, considering it was also measured in control samples, this detection may reflect contamination.Two fungal species detected among the most abundant taxa (PseudoperonosporaandPenicillium) are of particular note.Pseudoperonospora cubensisis a fungal pathogen with a wide geographical distribution that can infect produce including cantaloupe, cucumber, pumpkin, squash and watermelon42. Similarly,Penicillium aurantiogriseumfound in our dataset, can cause spoilage of various food products43.\n\nMost previous high altitude aerobiology studies have lacked rigorous control measurements, making it difficult to determine whether taxa reported came from the atmosphere (native biomass) or the sampling systems (false positives). Accordingly, in this study we followed the protocol described44where a comprehensive set of controls were reported to provide a transparent picture of baseline contamination associated with the study. The approach, summarized in brief, included descriptions of: (1) sterilization methods; (2) ground transportation controls; (3) hardware controls; (4) laboratory/assay controls; and (5) any contamination results measured. With the improved sensitivity of most molecular methods, including the DNA based detection assays reported herein, some level of baseline contamination will always be expected for environmental and laboratory controls. Consequently, our study relied upon data analysis techniques that showed the \"signal to noise\", including ordination plots comparing how environmental (atmospheric) samples clustered significantly apart from the sampling system or laboratory control samples (Supplementary TableS2and Fig.S6). Of course, the analysis approach also identified common taxa across environmental and control groups; for example,Achromobacter xylosoxidansandBradyrhizobiumsp. DFCI 1 where the two species were detected in both flight samples and control samples. In this case, the overlap indicates likely contamination soAchromobacter xylosoxidansandBradyrhizobiumsp. DFCI 1 were probably not sampled from the atmosphere.\n\nViable bacteria measured in our study (e.g.,Bacillus zhangzhouensis,Bacillus pumilus) included some endospore formers resistant to extremes and frequently reported in other high altitude surveys2,3. Using high altitude balloons for collecting bioaerosols up to 125,000 ft (38km), Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria isolates were recovered45. Ground based simulations using the stratospheric isolates estimated that some bacteria could survive long range transport in the atmosphere up to 140days if shaded from direct sunlight45. It is therefore plausible that many other viable (but non cultured) microorganisms can be identified in this metagenomics dataset.\n\nThe long range dispersal of viable bioaerosols may be critical to understanding agricultural and public health implications because the troposphere and lower stratosphere can enable microbial dispersal over geographic barriers3. Most knowledge in this emerging area of aerobiology comes from regional studies. Soybean rust, for instance, has been correlated with incoming dust storms46. Valley Fever outbreaks in the Southwest of US is thought to be caused by dust storms carrying a fungal pathogen,Coccidioides immitis47. Desert storms in sub Saharan Africa have also been linked to outbreaks of a deadly bacterium,Neisseria meningitides,affecting 26 countries and more than 300 million people. This same region, also called\"the Meningitis belt\"47, is also prone to epidemics such as malaria. Interestingly, we measured a strong DNA signature ofTetrahymena(first flight day at 10,000 ft), a ciliated protozoan typically found in aquatic ecosystems. No previous aerobiology survey has detected airborne protozoa at such heights above the Earth's boundary layer. Another unexpected DNA signal wasPinus(second flight day at 10,000 ft), suggesting the sampled air mass had recently passed over forested terrain in the US Sierra Nevada mountains   taken together with the back trajectory model at 10,000 ft, the result might demonstrate how orographic uplift connects regional surface emissions with the upper atmosphere.\n\nAcross two consecutive sampling days, the atmospheric microbiome was dynamically changing at each altitude.Lachnoanaerobaculum,Alcaligenes, Mycobacterium,Tetrahymena,andVeillonellawere abundant on the first day, whilePenicillium, Prevotella, Pseudoperonospora,andPorphyromononaswere only enriched on the second day. Such temporal variability is common in other aerobiology reports and is further supported by the different back trajectories of the two days (Supplementary Fig.S7). A recent study examined how local topography and wind conditions can influence regional bioaerosol dynamics.BacillusandSphingomonas(for bacteria) andPseudotaeniolina globaosaandCladophialophora proteae(for fungi) were the most abundant taxa detected, but the authors observed relative abundance varying at disparate sampling locations12. Similarly, another study showed that diurnal cycles in the boundary layer resulted in fungal and bacterial aerosols shifting with temperature, humidity, and CO2conditions48. Both dry and wet deposition significantly influence bioaerosol patterns and it is worth emphasizing our flights occurred in non cloudy, precipitation free areas49. With a multiyear campaign lasting seven years at an alpine field site in Spain, dynamic, seasonal shifts in 16S rRNA measurements (yielding mostly Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria) were found4. One bacterial genus showing up in high relative abundance in both our study and that of the study in Spain4wasStenotrophomonas. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria are other common phyla between our results and other vertically sampled air masses over desert regions in Asia50.\n\nMost previous vertical aerobiology studies relied upon 16S rRNA amplicon methods, which targets and PCR amplifies short regions of the 16S gene, for characterizing bacteria sampled4,12,45,50,51, whereas our shotgun metagenomics approach has the capacity to detect a broader taxonomic range with higher resolution, to the species or strain/plasmid level. Metagenomic sequencing provides relative quantitation based on the number of reads for each taxon identified; but it does not provide absolute DNA concentrations. Producing more accurate human, animal, and plant impact forecasting models will benefit from quantitative information about abundance (e.g., DNA concentration or cell counts) and, to a lesser extent, the size distribution of bioaerosols. For now, we rely upon other datasets for quantitative information that we were unable to acquire in this study. Depending on the altitude sampled, in previous reports of airborne bacteria, the bacteria concentration ranged from 103to 107cellsm 3over 3,300 to 26,000 ft (1 8km)51. Separately, it was found that total airborne bacterial concentrations at 9,800 ft (3km) were similar to values at 95,000 ft (29km), approximately 5x105cellsm 345. Another study examined the size distribution of bioaerosols associated with near surface pollution, and similar research will be needed to more robustly characterize microorganisms reaching the upper atmosphere52. One challenge with using the ABC system onboard the C 20A is that the geometry of the aerosol inlet likely prevents most large aerosols (>4um) from reaching the collector2. Therefore, more efficient, size inclusive sampling methods will need to be developed in future years, in addition to including instruments that can be useful for characterizing atmospheric species in real time as well as provide useful information for use in fate, transport, and exposure modeling8.\n\nAn uptick of international aerobiology studies is finally allowing global atmospheric microbiome patterns to be examined. However, the surge of recent literature also underscores the importance of developing consistent sampling and analysis methodologies11. One of the primary goals of our work was to demonstrate that vertical bioaerosol measurements could be made across the troposphere using the most sensitive molecular methods available. Our metagenomics dataset and modeling analysis provides a more inclusive framework for planning field campaigns that will someday make concurrent measurements at emission sources and downwind locations. In the Central Valley, for instance, bioaerosols picked up by easterly winds, heading towards the US Sierra Nevada mountain range, might be sampled near the source (adjacent to agricultural fields), in the air (using aircraft), and on the ground (at alpine field observatories). Such multipronged efforts may result in refined forecast models for winds carrying potentially disruptive pathogens.\n\nThe raw FASTQ files are available in the NASA GeneLab repository under the accession number GLDS 256.",
