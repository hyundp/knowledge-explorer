    "abstract": "Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi  and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments withBrassica rapaverified that that gravitropism like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.\n\nSubject terms:Biological techniques, Biophysics, Plant sciences",
    "methods": "Brassica rapa, var. rapaseeds were commercially sourced. No approvals were required for the study, which complied with all relevant regulations. Seeds were attached to germination paper with polyvinyl acetate (clear Elmer's) glue such that the micropyle was oriented toward the opening of seed cassettes (Sup. Fig.1). The seeds cassettes were designed to fit into specially designed magnetic field chambers (MFCs, Fig.1).\n\nThe experiment was a follow up of the STS 107 experiment that was lost as a result of the shuttle accident in 2003. A computer (PC104 stack) controlled all aspects and was remotely operated such that no crew involvement was necessary. The experimental principle of the hardware (Fig.1) and the arrangement of the components is shown in Sup. Fig.2. Experiment initialization, water dispensation, image acquisition, temperature and pressure recording, and termination of the experiment by fixation were remotely initiated and controlled by the hardware's own computer. The entire hardware was custom built at the Kennedy Space Center using several iterations and named Biotube MICRo (MagneticInduction ofCurvature inRoots).\n\nThe MFCs consisted of machined aluminum cases each containing 10 Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnets, 12.7mm thick with a magnetization of about 30,000 Oe (~3 Tesla, Magnet Sales and Manufacturing, Culver City, CA). The magnetic circuit was closed by two yokes. To the surface of each magnet, two wedges of ferromagnetic steel (equilateral cross section, 6mm high, 50mm long) were attached that generated the magnetic gradients (Fig.1). Between each pair of magnets seed cassettes were inserted that contained 10Brassica rapaseeds. Five seeds each were glued (Elmer's clear glue) along the long edges of germination paper. Roots that emerged from the seed cassettes were expected to curve away from the wedges.\n\nA camera system consisting of eight cameras on either side was installed between two of the three MFCs such that the cameras were positioned opposite a window that permitted viewing the seed cassettes. Illumination was achieved by a single IR LED (750 800nm) to avoid phototropic stimulation. The LEDs were activated only during imaging. The cameras acquired images in two minute intervals and the video signal together with temperature, and atmospheric pressure data and position number were transmitted to the Kennedy Space Center (Florida) as well as recorded internally on a hard drive.\n\nThe experiment was launched on Space X3 (April 18, 2014) and initiated after 19days by dispensing 400uL deionized water to each seed cassette from a Micro Effusion Device for Space Applications (MEDUSA). The seeds germinated after about 22h. The experiment was terminated after 48h by the injection of RNA Later into MFC C (first in the fixation sequence, not imaged), injection of 4% formaldehyde in PHEMD buffer50in MFC A (image sequences designated 'Y'). MFC B received RNALater, was designated 'Z' and third in the fixation sequence. MFC C did not contain magnets but Al blocks of identical dimensions as the magnets and served as control. The dispensation of the respective fixative was initiated by pressurizing an aluminum chamber that contained sealed bags with fixative, one for each MFC. A solenoid valve controlled fixative flow to one MFC at a time. Excess liquid was collected in a second bag housed in a plastic cage. The entire hardware and fixed plant material deorbited on May 20, 2014. After 2days the hardware was received at the Kennedy Space Center, and sample processing was completed during the next 3days. A ground control using the space hardware was performed at the Kennedy Space Center on a large clinostat (8/12 8/15/14, 1.5rpm) and at the University of Louisiana using single clinorotated MFCs without imaging but under otherwise identical conditions.\n\nImage sequences were obtained from HD stored files and compiled as video sequences (Sup. Video1and Sup. Video2). Root curvature was recorded from seed cassettes that were submersed in the same buffer as during fixation in an upright position and photographed from four sides. After disassembly of the seed cassettes, root appearance was categorized as germinated, straight, or curved. Curvature was evaluated as affected by HGMF only if the root length was sufficient to reach the HGMF area and corresponding curvature was visible. Only roots that were exposed to HGMF were used for the transcriptome analysis.\n\nMicroscopy was performed on seedlings fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PHEMD buffer50. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and 100% acetone and embedded in Spurr's resin. Longitudinal median sections (2um thick) were cut on an ultra microtome (Sorvall MT2 B) and stained with toluidine blue (0.1% [w/v] in 0.1% [w/v] boric acid). The serial sections were photographed with a digital camera (Sony DKC ST5) and measured using ImageJ (v.1.53).\n\nRNA extraction was performed in four separate sections of seedlings (root tip, root proper, hypocotyl, and cotyledons) using a kit (Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit, Sigma STRN250) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transcription analysis was performed after reverse transcription (High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) and qPCR reactions for 16 different genes using specific primers, with stable and suitable efficiencies (Sup. Table1). Conditions for the amplification on a Step one real time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific) included a 2min incubation at 95 degreesC, followed by 40 cycles (95 degreesC for 10s; 60 degreesC for 10s) with fluorescent readings taken at the end of the annealing cycle. Quality control included melt curve analyses and capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel Advanced).\n\nThe assessment of the space environment on seedling biology was examined using qPCR data of 16 genes. Typically, qPCR data rely on so called reference or housekeeping genes, but this approach does not consider that the environmental conditions (space flight, clinorotation, and static growth conditions) are likely to affect reference genes themselves. Therefore, we compared the entire data sets against each other based on all studied conditions. If no difference exists between the two data sets, then such plots result in a diagonal line with a slope of one. The evaluation based on slope and variance (R2value) as indicator of overall stability of gene activity also provides information on significantly affected genes. Such data points will show up as 'outliers' from the bulk distribution51. This approach was evaluated based on four individual tissues of the seedlings, resulting in 64 data points (16 genesx4 tissue types), for each treatment.\n\nThe most relevant comparison of the explained type focuses on the effect of weightlessness and HGMFs in addition to the effect of clinorotation and static, 1g controls. The complete set of comparisons is provided as Sup. Table2. Transcription data were evaluated based on correspondence plots of pairwise comparisons. Significant changes in transcriptions were evaluated by the Mean Method51, and statistical significance was based on Z scores.",
    "results": "Each MFC contained eight seed cassettes with ten seeds each. Seed germination in the two MFCs with HGMFs was higher than in the non magnetic chamber (Table1), indicating that the presence of magnets and magnetic fields did not negatively affect germination.\n\nGermination and root length ofBrassica rapaseeds in magnetic field chambers with (A&B) and without magnets (C).\n\nThere was no difference between chambers or seed cassettes.\n\nExposure to HGMF induced curvature (Sup. Video1, Table2). However, substantial curvature occurred in both presence and absence of magnetic gradients. The non magnetic chamber showed 81% curvature in roots within the seed cassette around the germination paper (Fig.2).\n\nGermination and curvature in the presence and absence of HGMFs of a total of 80 seeds per MFC.\n\naRefers to roots that never emerged from the seed cassette or were too short to reach the HGMF area (as shown in Fig.2).\n\nExample of root orientation inside seed cassettes. The predominant curvature and elongation occurred onto and along the surface of the germination paper.\n\nMFCs with magnets showed curvature that was independent of the HGMF because of growth patterns or curvature occurring inside the seed cassettes where the magnetic gradient was too weak to affect curvature.\n\nThe comparison of space grown or static ground control seedlings exposed to HGMF with seedlings grown in the non magnetic field chamber (#1 and #23 in Sup. Table2) shows strong correspondence between the two conditions (Fig.3), indicating that magnetic fields do not affect general metabolism or transcription activity. This notion is in line with reports that failed to detect effects of magnetic fields on growth52,53but contrasts with effects of weak magnetic fields on root curvature54and effects of the geomagnetic field on stress response and hormesis55,56. The geomagnetic field (typically about 0.5 G) is orders of magnitude weaker than the employed magnetic fields in this research (ca. 30 kG).\n\nTranscription values between space grownBrassica rapaseedlings (A, #1) and static ground controls (B, #23) in the presence and absence of HGMFs show strong correlation (unity slope) and low scatter (R2=0.85 and 0.95), indicating no or low effect of magnetic fields on transcription. Panels (C) and (D) identify the examined tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The data sets usePFKas reference and show efficiency corrected Cqand log(2) transformed values.\n\nThese data indicate that factors other than HGMF induce curvature and the most likely factor is hydrotropism18,32,57. The lack of a gravity stimulus and the distance between the germination paper and the HGMF generating wedges resulted in a large number of roots confined to the germination paper. The same factor also applied to seedlings in the magnetic chambers and resulted in reduced numbers of roots reaching the HGMF. However, the unambiguous evidence for curvature in space (see Sup. Video1) and clinorotated seedlings (Sup. Video2) indicates that HGMFs do have the ability to induce curvature as had been demonstrated earlier in roots, coleoptiles, inflorescences, and hypocotyls16,17,26,58,59.\n\nThe presumably hydrotropic growth reduced the number of roots that reached the influence of the HGMFs. Therefore, the overall number of roots curving in response to the magnetic gradient was low (Table2).\n\nExamining the gravisensing mechanism includes measuring the size of the presumptive sensors as previous work has shown that gravisensitivity depends on the amount of starch in amyloplasts60. Assuming equal density, the diameter of amyloplasts determines the relative mass. Measurements of amyloplasts in columella cells differed between the space grown, clinorotated, and statically grown ground controls (Fig.4) and indicates that the amyloplast size and therefore the gravisensing mechanism is responsive to the growth condition, notably weightlessness and clinorotation that respectively reduces and enhances mechanostimulation.\n\nSize distribution of amyloplasts in the root cap of Brassica rapa seedlings grown in space, on the ground or in a clinostat. The data were compiled from 2um thick longitudinal sections of root cap tissue after fixation in paraformaldehyde. The difference between space and clinostat amyloplasts was highly significant (P<10 4); the difference between static ground control and clinorotated amyloplasts was significant at the 5% level. Data were normalized based on 290, 243, and 210 amyloplast measurements for space, clinorotated, and static ground control plants, respectively.\n\nEarlier analyses of starch from space and ground controls found that ethylene reduces starch particle size and that in cotyledons starch particles sizes in space and ground controls were of equal size61. Since we used activated charcoal cloth to absorb volatile organic compounds (Fig.1), we assume that ethylene was not a factor in the different experiments. In addition, we examined the size distribution of amyloplasts in the root columella. Earlier work showed that amyloplasts in gravisensing tissues (root cap and endodermis) are about twice the size of other tissues7. Our data (Fig.4) indicate that the amyloplast size is responsive to the gravitational and mechanical stimulation. The reduced size after clinorotation, the average size in static 1 g controls, and the enlarged size in roots grown under 'micro gravity' conditions support the notion that the extent of gravitational stimulation is inversely proportional to the mass of the amyloplasts. Thus, plants not only perceive the direction of an accelerative force but adjust their (starch) metabolism according to the amount of stimulation. If this concept is correct, then it should be supported by gene transcription data. The following analyses confirm that amylase activity indeed is affected by mechanostimulation.\n\nSince four different tissue types were analyzed, tissue variability and response to spaceflight and clinorotation can be assessed for all examined tissues and genes. Based on distributions of transcription patterns (Figs.3and5), a comprehensive analysis of all treatment and tissue combinations was performed such that the scatter for each comparison and gene was determined based on the formula\n\nwhere j represents the tissue types (root tip, root proper, hypocotyl, cotyledons) and i the individual experimental comparisons (28, Sup. Table2) or examined genes (16). This value was calculated for each analyzed gene and the smallest value (scatter in Figs.3and5) was identified as the most stably transcribed gene (Table3).\n\nTranscription values for space grown and clinorotated KSC ground controls.Brassica rapaseedlings (A, #2) show strong reduction ofAMY1transcription in clinorotated seedlings (circle). A comparison between static and clinorotated seedlings (B, #27) shows higherAMY1transcription in non clinorotated seedlings. Panels (C) and (D) identify the tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The circled data indicateAMY1transcription relative toPFK. In both cases averageAMY1transcription was significantly different (p=0.002, left and p<0.001, right; n=64). The data sets usePFKas reference and show efficiency corrected Cqand log(2) transformed values.\n\nAssessment of the consistency of transcription data based on the average of examined tissues.\n\nThe top four choices of all combinations (as in Sup. Table2) are based on the percentage that resulted in the least scatter of all 448 combinations (16 genes by 28 comparisons).\n\nThe distribution of the least variable gene transcription varied greatly (Table3). Although common reference genes (e.g.,TUB1, ACT7) are represented (Table3), the observation that individual tissues differed in the genes of greatest stability and that the average of all tissues resulted in different assortments suggested that referring transcription data to the average of all measurements (i.e., the regression lines in Figs.3and5) is superior to relying on a single gene. BecausePFKshowed the greatest stability for all tissues, we placedPFKat the origin of the coordinate system (0/0). However, the results explained below are independent of this selection.\n\nThe comparisons (Sup. Table2) show the least and most significant effect on gene expression and can be used to identify the conditions that induce physiological responses in brassica seedlings. The greatest stability in gene transcription was seen for treatments with similar mechanical load, for example, static growth with and without HGMF, or clinorotated samples (KSC and Lab). The largest scatter or least consistent transcription pattern was associated with different mechanical loads such as flight (i.e., no mechanical load) and clinorotation (enhanced mechanical load), or static and space flight conditions. The main conclusion of these evaluations is that HGMFs or more generally, strong magnetic fields, do not affect transcription; HGMF data are equally present in the most and least affected conditions (Table4). However, a comparison between clinorotated experiments with the original flight hardware at KSC and experiments in our lab (comparison # 17 and # 22) show statistically significant differences (Sup. Fig.4).\n\nThe similarity of gene transcription between pairs of treatments based on high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) or no magnetic fields (no MF) that were applied during the space flight (Flight), on ground controls (static), or during clinorotation (Clino) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) or in the laboratory (Lab).\n\nThe values were obtained by averaging the R2values that resulted from using each of the 16 genes as reference (i.e., origin in graphical comparisons such as Figs.3and5and Sup. Figs.3 and 4).\n\naNumbers refer to Sup. Table2.\n\nData sets comparing space grown with clinorotated seedlings show large scatter and offset (Fig.5A and Sup. Fig.3A), suggesting that the shift in the transcription pattern is not dependent on HGMF but differences in mechanostimulation (i.e., clinorotation). This effect is especially noticeable forAMY1. The effect of clinorotation on amylase transcription is independent of the HGMF because transcription ofAMY1in the absence of HGMF was higher in static seedlings than clinorotated seedlings (Fig.5B). Space flight and clinorotation resulted in reduced and elevated transcription, respectively. A similar pattern was observed between clinorotated and static samples; however, HGMF had no effect (Sup. Fig.3). The alteredAMY1transcription between clinorotation at KSC and our lab is related to different stabilities of the hardware. The flight hardware contained a webbing like base mount (implemented because of weight concerns), which provided stable support during space flight but flexed readily during clinorotation compared to a rigid assembly on the laboratory clinostat.\n\nThe transcription data correspond with the observed size distribution of amyloplasts (Fig.4) and indicate that amyloplast size is regulated by starch degradation in clinorotated seedlings and amylase repression (starch accumulation) in space samples. Together these observations indicate that plant adapt to the weightlessness of space by increasing their amyloplast size which likely enhances their gravisensitivity. In contrast, clinorotation represents excessive mechanostimulation and leads to a reduction of amyloplast size through enhanced degradation (amylase transcription).\n\nThe observedAMY1levels between space grown and clinorotated seedlings were independent of reference genes; the effect persisted regardless of whatever gene was used as reference. This observation supports using transcription of all available genes as a reliable approach to identifying transcriptional changes of individual genes.\n\nTheAMY1data correspond to earlier observations of enhanced gravisensitivity of space grown lentil seedlings62,63and reduced starch after clinorotation64. Although the STS 107 flight experiment could not be retrieved to measure amyloplast size, the image analysis of flax seedlings indicated that the magnetic gradient had stronger effects than during previous ground experiments because the root curvature started at a greater distance from the HGMF inducing wedge27than during ground controls. This observation is in line with the present data and strongly supports greater (gravi)sensitivity of plants growing in a microgravity environment.\n\nThe current report is the first to associate starch metabolism with amyloplasts size and gravisensitivity. The larger amyloplasts in space grown plants suggest that the application of HGMFs in space is more effective than in earth grown and especially in clinorotated plants. However, the unreliable growth direction of roots makes HGMF difficult to implement.\n\nGravisensitivity has also been linked to changes in calcium in statocytes65 67and calcium has been shown to stabilize alpha amylase68 70. Therefore, Ca2+and amylase are controlling element for the starch content in statocytes. However, starch content is the result of homeostasis for catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Starch biosynthesis depends on a complex set of enzymes that include phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)71, phosphoglucomutase (PGM)72,73, and starch synthases (SSs)71,74among others. Data on the balance between starch degradation and starch biosynthesis undoubtedly would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of starch metabolism to reduced and enhanced mechanostimulation. However, the limited set of transcriptionally analyzed genes prevents a more thorough assessment of starch biosynthesis in response to altered mechanostimulation. Future space experiments might remedy this shortcoming.\n\nAlthough weightlessness is the dominant difference between ground and space flights, the lack of density driven gas exchange and water distribution are equally significant alterations for plant growth in space. Because the flight hardware was enclosed in a hermetically sealed (triple contained) chamber, atmospheric effects can be excluded. Therefore, the following considerations only apply to gravity effects. Comparing the number of significantly (P < 0.05) affected combinations (genes by reference), shows the largest effect onAMY1transcription (Fig.6).\n\nThe percentage of significant (P<0.05) changes in gene transcription in response to space, HGMF and clinorotation ofBrassica rapaseedlings. Compared toAMY1,all other genes showed fewer significant alterations (% of 16 genesx16 references).\n\nGenes other thanAMY1responded to specific conditions but at reduced power.ACT7showed modifications only when comparing clinorotation at KSC with static growth (Comparisons #19 & #20);ACT7was not affected by HGMF but sensitive to vibrations (higher frequency movements in excess to the 1.5rpm of the clinostat). This relationship is similar to the enhanced AMY1 transcription addressed in Sup. Fig.4. The enhanced oscillation can be verified by the jitter in Sup. Video2. To improve visibility, the individual frames were aligned, but the inconsistent position of imprinted data confirms the added vibrational stimulation that affectedACT7activation (and enhancedAMY1transcription) compared to regular (smooth) clinorotation.\n\nCOXshowed the strongest upregulation in space flight material compared with static growth conditions (#4, #5, #10 #11) but was not affected by HGMF. This observation further supports the claim that magnetic fields do not affect transcription. Instead, COX responds to space flight associated stress as has been shown previously for fish brain75and skeletal muscle76. Changes inG6PDH5were limited to treatment differences between space flight and clinorotation (#8, #12, #15, #16) and correspond to earlier reports of altered enzyme activities of pine seedlings after exposure to clinorotation and hyper g77and enzyme activities in artemia cysts after space flight78.IAA5andPIN7responded to HGMF both under flight (PIN7) and clinorotation (IAA5) and underscores their relevance for auxin modification of growth. Although the number of roots that curved in response to HGMF was low (Table2), it is possible that differential growth (curvature in response to hydrotropism?) affected the transcription of these genes. GLK did not respond significantly; changes were not limited to any particular condition and therefore cannot be associated with specific experimental conditions but likely represent natural variations.UBq1, Tub1, ADH1, HXK, PFK, SUS, PIN1showed no significant changes in transcription and therefore could all serve as references. The lack of response ofADH1is surprising as this gene was previously identified as space stress indicator79,80. TAGL is the only gene that shows reduced transcription in the presence of magnetic fields but only in clinorotated samples. While there is precedence that the lipid metabolism is affected by hypergravity81and clinorotation82, this is the first observation that magnetic fields might contribute to such changes.\n\nIn summary, our data support plant proprioception of weightlessness and metabolic control of amyloplast size. The adjustment of size and mass of amyloplasts indicates that plants perceive gravity and ponderomotive forces, which provide not only enhanced gravisensitivity but also explain some metabolic responses to space conditions. The advantage of a sealed environment suggests that this effect is not an artefact but related to gravitational and mechanosensory responses. The results also demonstrate that HGMF do not influence gene transcription. Future work needs to investigate the role of other starch related genes to understand the entire dynamic of metabolic plasticity that relates to weightlessness.",

In both cases average AMY1 transcription was significantly different (p=0.002, left and p<0.001, right; n=64). The data sets use PFK as reference and show efficiency corrected C q and log(2) transformed values. Table 3.

Table 2 ) are based on the percentage that resulted in the least scatter of all 448 combinations (16 genes by 28 comparisons). The distribution of the least variable gene transcription varied greatly (Table 3 ). Although common reference genes (e.g., TUB1, ACT7 ) are represented (Table 3 ), the observation that individual tissues differed in the genes of greatest stability and that the average of all tissues resulted in different assortments suggested that referring transcription data to the average of all measurements (i.e., the regression lines in Figs. 3 and 5 ) is superior to relying on a single gene. Because PFK showed the greatest stability for all tissues, we placed PFK at the origin of the coordinate system (0/0). However, the results explained below are independent of this selection. The comparisons (Sup. Table 2 ) show the least and most significant effect on gene expression and can be used to identify the conditions that induce physiological responses in brassica seedlings. The greatest stability in gene transcription was seen for treatments with similar mechanical load, for example, static growth with and without HGMF, or clinorotated samples (KSC and Lab). The largest scatter or least consistent transcription pattern was associated with different mechanical loads such as flight (i.e., no mechanical load) and clinorotation (enhanced mechanical load), or static and space flight conditions. The main conclusion of these evaluations is that HGMFs or more generally, strong magnetic fields, do not affect transcription; HGMF data are equally present in the most and least affected conditions (Table 4 ). However, a comparison between clinorotated experiments with the original flight hardware at KSC and experiments in our lab (comparison # 17 and # 22) show statistically significant differences (Sup. Fig. 4 ). Table 4.

Figs. 3 and 4 ). a Numbers refer to Sup. Table 2 .\n\nSensitivity of AMY1 Data sets comparing space grown with clinorotated seedlings show large scatter and offset (Fig. 5 A and Sup. Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the shift in the transcription pattern is not dependent on HGMF but differences in mechanostimulation (i.e., clinorotation). This effect is especially noticeable for AMY1 . The effect of clinorotation on amylase transcription is independent of the HGMF because transcription of AMY1 in the absence of HGMF was higher in static seedlings than clinorotated seedlings (Fig. 5 B). Space flight and clinorotation resulted in reduced and elevated transcription, respectively. A similar pattern was observed between clinorotated and static samples; however, HGMF had no effect (Sup. Fig. 3 ). The altered AMY1 transcription between clinorotation at KSC and our lab is related to different stabilities of the hardware. The flight hardware contained a webbing like base mount (implemented because of weight concerns), which provided stable support during space flight but flexed readily during clinorotation compared to a rigid assembly on the laboratory clinostat. The transcription data correspond with the observed size distribution of amyloplasts (Fig. 4 ) and indicate that amyloplast size is regulated by starch degradation in clinorotated seedlings and amylase repression (starch accumulation) in space samples. Together these observations indicate that plant adapt to the weightlessness of space by increasing their amyloplast size which likely enhances their gravisensitivity. In contrast, clinorotation represents excessive mechanostimulation and leads to a reduction of amyloplast size through enhanced degradation (amylase transcription). The observed AMY1 levels between space grown and clinorotated seedlings were independent of reference genes; the effect persisted regardless of whatever gene was used as reference. This observation supports using transcription of all available genes as a reliable approach to identifying transcriptional changes of individual genes. The AMY1 data correspond to earlier observations of enhanced gravisensitivity of space grown lentil seedlings 62 , 63 and reduced starch after clinorotation 64 . Although the STS 107 flight experiment could not be retrieved to measure amyloplast size, the image analysis of flax seedlings indicated that the magnetic gradient had stronger effects than during previous ground experiments because the root curvature started at a greater distance from the HGMF inducing wedge 27 than during ground controls. This observation is in line with the present data and strongly supports greater (gravi)sensitivity of plants growing in a microgravity environment. The current report is the first to associate starch metabolism with amyloplasts size and gravisensitivity. The larger amyloplasts in space grown plants suggest that the application of HGMFs in space is more effective than in earth grown and especially in clinorotated plants. However, the unreliable growth direction of roots makes HGMF difficult to implement. Gravisensitivity has also been linked to changes in calcium in statocytes 65   67 and calcium has been shown to stabilize alpha amylase 68   70 . Therefore, Ca 2+ and amylase are controlling element for the starch content in statocytes. However, starch content is the result of homeostasis for catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Starch biosynthesis depends on a complex set of enzymes that include phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) 71 , phosphoglucomutase (PGM) 72 , 73 , and starch synthases (SSs) 71 , 74 among others. Data on the balance between starch degradation and starch biosynthesis undoubtedly would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of starch metabolism to reduced and enhanced mechanostimulation. However, the limited set of transcriptionally analyzed genes prevents a more thorough assessment of starch biosynthesis in response to altered mechanostimulation. Future space experiments might remedy this shortcoming.\n\nGenes other than AMY1 Although weightlessness is the dominant difference between ground and space flights, the lack of density driven gas exchange and water distribution are equally significant alterations for plant growth in space. Because the flight hardware was enclosed in a hermetically sealed (triple contained) chamber, atmospheric effects can be excluded. Therefore, the following considerations only apply to gravity effects. Comparing the number of significantly (P < 0.05) affected combinations (genes by reference), shows the largest effect on AMY1 transcription (Fig. 6 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab The percentage of significant (P<0.05) changes in gene transcription in response to space, HGMF and clinorotation of Brassica rapa seedlings. Compared to AMY1, all other genes showed fewer significant alterations (% of 16 genesx16 references). Genes other than AMY1 responded to specific conditions but at reduced power. ACT7 showed modifications only when comparing clinorotation at KSC with static growth (Comparisons #19 & #20); ACT7 was not affected by HGMF but sensitive to vibrations (higher frequency movements in excess to the 1.5rpm of the clinostat). This relationship is similar to the enhanced AMY1 transcription addressed in Sup. Fig. 4 . The enhanced oscillation can be verified by the jitter in Sup. Video 2 . To improve visibility, the individual frames were aligned, but the inconsistent position of imprinted data confirms the added vibrational stimulation that affected ACT7 activation (and enhanced AMY1 transcription) compared to regular (smooth) clinorotation. COX showed the strongest upregulation in space flight material compared with static growth conditions (#4, #5, #10 #11) but was not affected by HGMF. This observation further supports the claim that magnetic fields do not affect transcription. Instead, COX responds to space flight associated stress as has been shown previously for fish brain 75 and skeletal muscle 76 . Changes in G6PDH5 were limited to treatment differences between space flight and clinorotation (#8, #12, #15, #16) and correspond to earlier reports of altered enzyme activities of pine seedlings after exposure to clinorotation and hyper g 77 and enzyme activities in artemia cysts after space flight 78 . IAA5 and PIN7 responded to HGMF both under flight ( PIN7 ) and clinorotation ( IAA5 ) and underscores their relevance for auxin modification of growth. Although the number of roots that curved in response to HGMF was low (Table 2 ), it is possible that differential growth (curvature in response to hydrotropism?) affected the transcription of these genes. GLK did not respond significantly; changes were not limited to any particular condition and therefore cannot be associated with specific experimental conditions but likely represent natural variations. UBq1, Tub1, ADH1, HXK, PFK, SUS, PIN1 showed no significant changes in transcription and therefore could all serve as references. The lack of response of ADH1 is surprising as this gene was previously identified as space stress indicator 79 , 80 . TAGL is the only gene that shows reduced transcription in the presence of magnetic fields but only in clinorotated samples. While there is precedence that the lipid metabolism is affected by hypergravity 81 and clinorotation 82 , this is the first observation that magnetic fields might contribute to such changes. In summary, our data support plant proprioception of weightlessness and metabolic control of amyloplast size. The adjustment of size and mass of amyloplasts indicates that plants perceive gravity and ponderomotive forces, which provide not only enhanced gravisensitivity but also explain some metabolic responses to space conditions. The advantage of a sealed environment suggests that this effect is not an artefact but related to gravitational and mechanosensory responses. The results also demonstrate that HGMF do not influence gene transcription. Future work needs to investigate the role of other starch related genes to understand the entire dynamic of metabolic plasticity that relates to weightlessness.",
