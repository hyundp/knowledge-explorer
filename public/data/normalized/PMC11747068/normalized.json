    "abstract": "Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb unloaded rats.\n\nFirstly, we leveraged scRNA seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package \"Cellchat\" was used to reveal ligand receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading.\n\nClustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions.\n\nThis study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on vascular deconditioning following long duration spaceflight.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018 024 05572 x.\n\nKeywords:Single cell RNA sequencing, Weightlessness, Carotid artery, Femoral artery, Cellular communication, Transcription factor",
    "methods": "A total of 12 male Sprague Dawley rats (Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China), aged eight weeks and sourced, were randomly allocated to either the hindlimb unloading (HU,n=6) or the control group (Con,n=6). The tail suspension technique, a well established model for simulating microgravity conditions, was employed and has been comprehensively detailed in our previous work [6]. The detailed steps are shown in supplementary methods.\n\nThe rats were initially anesthetized using carbon dioxide according to AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020). Subsequently, they were euthanized through exsanguination, facilitated by a transcardial perfusion with 50 mL of PBS. After the removal of surrounding perivascular adipose and connective tissues, the CA and FA were pooled from 6 rats in each group (Con and HU). As described before [7], the isolated arteries were then sectioned into smaller pieces. These sections were subjected to enzymatic digestion using 2mg/mL of collagenase I (17018 029, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 2mg/mL of dispase II (D4693, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in Hank's balanced salt solution, incubated at 37 degreesC for 30min. The enzymatic digestion process was halted by adding PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by vigorous pipetting for 5 to 10 times to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting cell suspension was then filtered through a 30um cell strainer and subsequently centrifuged.\n\nCells were enumerated using a cell counter and then adjusted to an optimal concentration, ensuring no less than 1000 cells per microliter. Subsequently, the cell suspension was prepared for single cell sequencing on the 10x Genomics GemCode platform. The cells were combined with enzymes and bonded to Gel Beads, each impregnated with unique barcode information. This mixture was then processed through the 10x Genomics instrument, which encapsulated the cells within oil surfactant droplets to form single cell GEM. Following this, primers were released and thoroughly mixed with the cell lysates upon the dissolution of the Gel Beads. This facilitated the reverse transcription of barcoded, full length cDNA. PCR amplification was performed using cDNA as template for library construction. Finally, the libraries were sequenced utilizing the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits, version 3.1. The quality control, normalizing and dimentional reduction are shown in supplementary methods.\n\nThe graph based clustering and the optimal cluster resolution were performed according to previously identified PCs. For visual representation, t SNE was employed, utilizing the same set of PCs to encapsulate the data's high dimensional structure. Cluster identity was assigned by applying the Single R package according to classic cell type markers. Detailed methods are shown in Supplementary methods.\n\nFor subclustering of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, gene expression data were processed with log normalization, gene filtration, PCA, clustering, t SNE. To identify subcluster specific markers, the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat was utilized, providing a comprehensive set of differentially expressed genes that could distinguish each subcluster.\n\nDifferentially expressed genes in specific cell types, clusters and differentially expressed genes between Con and HU were used to perform GO, KEGG and GSVA functional enrichment analysis. Each significantly enriched GO term refers to a type of ontology which belongs to molecular function, cellular component or biological process. Similarly, KEGG analysis identifies metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in differentially expressed genes. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package (version 1.26) to identify enriched pathways and cellular processes in different clusters and sub clusters.\n\nECs clusters, SMCs and fibroblasts were isolated and reprocessed using Seurat. Then the R package Monocle 2 [8] (version 2.26.0) was used to convert the above Seurat subsets to a Monocle object. The pseudotime kinetics of differentially expressed genes and the heatmap were displayed using the corresponding functions in the R package.\n\nLigand receptor pair analysis was conducted utilizing R package \"Cellchat\". Briefly, the communication probability or interaction strength of a specific ligand receptor pair was obtained according to the gene expression of signaling ligands, receptors and their cofactors contained in Cellchat software. Our analysis encompassed a spectrum of molecular interactions, including paracrine and autocrine signaling, ECM receptor interactions, and direct cell cell contact interactions. The probability of communication at the signaling pathway level was calculated according to the communication probabilities of all ligand receptor interactions in each signaling pathway.\n\nTo perform the cell cycle analysis, the Seurat R package was utilized to assign a cell cycle score to each cell by the expression levels of cell cycle markers (15 marker genes for G1 phase, 20 marker genes for S phase, 61 marker genes for G2 phase, 64 marker genes for M phase). Cells were then assigned to G1, S, or G2/M phases based on cell cycle scores.\n\nAnalysis was performed through SCENIC software, which integrates the GENIE3 algorithm, RcisTarget, and AUCell. TFs and their targets were obtained via GENIE3 algorithm. RcisTarget was used to calculate motifs that were significantly enriched in each co expression module. The potential direct targets of motif were then predicted. We then delineated gene regulatory networks, termed regulons, which encompass both the TFs and their associated target genes. The activity of each regulon was obtained based on normalized AUC score or AUC binary matrix via AUCell R package. Gene regulatory network was done using the cytoscape software. TF analysis in the part of pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed using FIMO tools from MEMEsuite (5.1.0).\n\nParaffin embedded tissues were sectioned at a 5mm thickness using a cryomicrotome (RM2016, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and these sections were subsequently mounted onto glass microscope slides. The slides were first deparaffinized in xylene I and II (20min each). Then xylene was eliminated in a graded series of alcohols (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%). The sections were incubated with H&E solution (G1005, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Finally, the stained images were digitized using a Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary).\n\nSections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X 100 (9036 19 5, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then blocked for 0.5h with goat serum. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody which was diluted 1:100 in TBST overnight at 4 degreesC. Following antibodies were used: anti CD31 (28083 1 AP, Proteintech, Cook County, Illinois, USA), anti eNOS (27120 1 AP, Proteintech), anti alpha SMA (67735 1 Ig, Proteintech), anti CD68 (28058 1 AP, Proteintech), anti CEBPB (66649 1 Ig, Proteintech), anti SPARC (15274 1 AP, Proteintech), anti KLF4 (11880 1 AP, Proteintech), anti SERPINE2 (11303 1 AP, Proteintech), anti TXNIP (18243 1 AP, Proteintech), anti FOSB (ab184938, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti ET 1 (DF6125, Affinity Bioscience, Melbourne, Australia), anti PDGFRalpha (sc 398206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), anti CXCR4 (sc 53534, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti PLN (ab219626, Abcam), anti DPT (10537 1 AP, Proteintech). After washing with PBS (three times, 5min each), the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies Fluor488 (1:500 dilution, EK011, Zhuangzhi Biotech, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China) or Cy3 (1:500 dilution, EK022, Zhuangzhi Biotech) for 1h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were scanned with Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH).\n\nIntima media thickness of CA and FA from Con and HU rats was represented as mean+/ standard error of mean. P value<0.05 determined by unpaired Student's t test was considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Although scRNA seq has extensively profiled vascular changes in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, a detailed single cell analysis of arterial adaptations in hindlimb suspended rats remains absent. We performed a systematic scRNA seq study on more than 22,000 cells from rat carotid and femoral arteries. These rats experienced three months of hindlimb unloading, with some serving as controls under normal gravity conditions. (Fig.1A). After quality control, 6742, 2983, 4487, 2463 cells were acquired in Con CA (carotid artery in contol group), Con FA (femoral artery in contol group), HU CA (carotid artery in hindlimb unloading group) and HU FA (femoral artery in hindlimb unloading group) datasets (Fig.1B), which correspond to the median of 2260.5, 2064, 1909 and 1825 genes per cell, respectively. The mean reads per cell were 37,089, 86,801, 62,761 and 113,861 in Con CA, Con FA, HU CA and HU FA.\n\nSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) atlas of Con and HU CA and FA. (A) Overview of experimental design and approach. CA and FA were collected from rats subjected to 3 months hindlimb unloading (HU) or exposed to normal gravity (Con). Then the single cell suspension was sequenced using scRNA seq method.

(G) Dot plot demonstrates the top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each type. Dot size corresponds to proportion of cells within the group expressing each transcript, and dot color corresponds to expression level. (H) The number of differentially expressed genes in each cell type compared to other cell types\n\nIndividual clusters were labeled for cell type with known marker genes. In total, we identified 23 cell clusters (Fig.1C) that could be divided into 10 major cell types (Fig.1D). Integrated datasets of above four groups displayed satisfactory alignment. Known markers used to divide cell types were shown in Additional file 1: Table. S1. Vascular cell types represented in the distinct clusters included ECs (cluster 5, 7, 11, 13, 20), VSMCs (cluster 0, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15), fibroblasts (cluster 1, 2, 4, 6, 12), macrophages (cluster 8), B cells (cluster 21), T cells (cluster 18), dendritic cells (cluster 17), neutrophil (cluster 19), neuron (cluster 22), and stem cells (cluster 16). The expression of marker genes across the 10 cell clusters were shown in Additional file 1: Fig.S1.\n\nWe then examined the distribution of major cell types within each group (Fig.1E, F, Additional file 1: Table. S2). Notably, the proportion of SMCs was elevated in the CA relative to the FA. Interestingly, a reduction in SMC fraction was observed in HU CA and HU FA compared to Con (Fig.1F). This finding contradicts prior studies suggesting that simulated weightlessness stimulates the proliferation of CA SMCs in rats [5]. Additionally, HU CA demonstrated a higher percentage of ECs compared with Con CA. Moreover, the HU FA group exhibited increased percentage of immune cells comprising B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils compared to Con FA.\n\nThen, we presented top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each cluster (Fig.1G). For example, the specific markers of ECs areMall,Cldn5,Vwf,Mmrn2,Gja5.Vwfis the canonical ECs gene.Cldn5, encoding a tight junction protein, andMmrn2, encoding an extracellular matrix protein known as Multimerin 2, were also highlighted. The markers of SMCs areActa1and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 (Kcnk3). Fibroblast marker isScara5, a class A scavenger receptor with the clearance function of foreign and endogenous material [9]. Here we also showed the number of upregulated genes with average fold change>1.28, P value<0.05 for each cell type compared to all other cells (Fig.1H). Consistent with previous findings, monocytes including dendritic cells and macrophages have more differentially expressed genes than other cell clusters [10].\n\nCurrently, there's no report on gene expression differences in SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts, and immune cells from carotid and femoral arteries under microgravity, mainly because isolating these cell types is difficult. After sequencing of flow sorted vascular cells, datasets from different cell types were aggregated in this study.\n\nWe first focused on the differentially expressed genes in ECs between Con and HU (Fig.2A, B). For ECM remodeling, genes encoding collagen such ascol4a1,col4a2were downregulated in both HU CA and HU FA. For secretory function of ECs, the increase ofVcam1andNos3suggested enhanced vasodilatation and adhesion of leukocytes in HU CA ECs. Downregulation ofEdn1which encodes ET 1 may give rise to decreased vasoconstriction and basal vascular tone in HU CA. The protein levels of eNOS (Fig.2C), which was coded byNos3, and ET 1 (Fig.2D) were verified by immunofluorescence.Mmrn1andVwfwere increased in HU CA, promoting platelet adhesion and clotting [11].Ccn1, essential for atherogenesis, was reported to be induced by oscillatory shear stress and inhibited by laminar shear stress [12]. It was upregulated in HU FA but downregulated in HU CA, highlighting the differential shear stress impacts on the CA and FA. KEGG pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, such asRpl37,Rpl36,Rpl35, in ECs from both HU CA and HU FA when compared to their Con counterparts (Fig.2E, F).\n\nArtery specific transcriptomic changes during hindlimb unloading and sub clusters of ECs. (A,B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (average log fold change>0.23, average fold change>1.28, P value<0.05) in HU CA ECs (A) and HU FA ECs (B) in comparison with Con counterparts.

(O) Pseudotime trajectories of EC sub cluster 4 in Con CA and HU CA. Scale bar, 40um\n\nSub clustering analysis of ECs revealed 6 sub clusters. Sub cluster 0 showed high expression ofIsl1(Fig.2G), a marker of embryonic stem cell derived progenitors [13], indicating the potential of self renewal. The sub cluster also featured increased expression ofBmp6, a gene implicated in osteogenic differentiation of ECs during vascular calcification [14]. This sub cluster showed enrichment for KEGG terms related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.2H), which was confirmed by GSVA analysis result that sub cluster 0 was involved in protein secretion and unfolded protein response (Fig.2I). Compared to FA, more ECs from CA were in sub cluster 0 (Fig.2J). Contrary to sub cluster 0, sub cluster 1 demonstrated a more enrichment of cell number in FA (Fig.2H).LipeandGpihbp1, involved in lipolytic process [15], were two markers for sub cluster 1. Sub cluster 1 specifically exhibited enrichment for the \"Rap1 signaling pathway\" and its downstream \"PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway\" (Fig.2K), which are known to play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this,Cxcl12, another marker of sub cluster 1, is recognized for its involvement in endothelial migration [16]. For EC sub cluster 2, marker genesRpl30andRps25were crucial for ribosome assembly and protein translation. Consistently, GO enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment for the terms \"Translation\" and \"Structural constituent of ribosome\" in EC sub cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The EC sub cluster 3 expressedLyve1, a lymphatic endothelial marker, suggesting this population was lymphatic endothelium. The definition of sub cluster 3 was further confirmed by the elevated expression ofCcl21, a chemokine produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Notably, there were more lymphatic endothelial cells in FA than that in CA (Fig.2J).Cnn1, a canonical marker of SMCs and a late indicator of EndoMT, is a hallmark of EC sub cluster 4 [17]. EndoMT is a process whereby endothelial cells undergo phenotype changes towards to mesenchymal cells such as SMCs and fibroblasts. EndoMT is integral to the pathogenesis of conditions such as hypertension induced vascular injury [18] and atherosclerosis [19]. The sub cluster 4 also expresses the myogenic markerActa2which encodes alpha SMA andPlnwhich encodes phospholamban, a regulator of ER Ca2+homeostasis in angiogenesis [20], suggesting a mesenchymal cell phenotype possibly due to EndoMT. To further confirm EndoMT, we compared the differential expression of endothelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers between the HU group and the Con group. The dot plot showed that the expression of Tie1, Cdh5, and Vwf was downregulated, whereas the expression of S100a4, Vimentin and smooth muscle cell markers Acta2, Spp1 and Cnn1 was upregulated in EC sub cluster 4 of HU CA in comparison with Con counterpart (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). Moreover, the expression of Cdh5 was decreased and the expression of S100a4, Vimentin was increased in EC sub cluster 5 of both HU CA and HU FA compared to their Con counterparts (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). Additionally, Cald1 is a molecule that distinguishes smooth muscle cells from fibroblasts, being exclusively expressed in smooth muscle cells [21]. The results demonstrated that the expression of Cald1 in sub cluster 4 was significantly higher than that in sub cluster 5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3C), suggesting the smooth muscle cell phenotype in sub cluster 4.\n\nTo delve deeper, we employed pseudotime analysis to simulate the EndoMT transition of EC sub clusters into fibroblasts and SMCs. As shown in Fig.2L, a subset of EC sub cluster 4 appeared to be positioned between the ECs and SMCs in biological evolution. Besides, sub cluster 5 of ECs was located at the intermediate stage of differentiation between fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Then 3 different cell states were identified: state 1, 2, 3. The ECs were primarily distributed in states 1, located in the initial state of the cell differentiation trajectory. The fibroblasts and SMCs were predominantly distributed in states 2 and 3, representing the final stage of the differentiation trajectory. Subsequently, genes with significant changes over pseudotime were clustered, followed by KEGG enrichment analysis for each cluster (Fig.2M). Cluster 1 gene set manifested protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Cluster 2 gene set exhibited enrichment of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, we used gene clusters 1 and 2 as target genes for TF prediction and foundEgr2,Spi1andNrf1may play important roles in the differentiation process of ECs to fibroblasts, andKlf15,Nr5a2andZfxmay be crucial for the transition of ECs into SMCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). We also compared the pseudotime trajectories between CA and FA. It was found that the process of EC sub cluster 4 differentiating into SMCs occured only in the CA while transition of ECs into fibroblasts occurred in CA and FA (Fig.2N). Besides, EC sub cluster 4 from HU CA exclusively exhibited differentiation into SMCs compared to Con CA, as shown in Fig.2O. Tail suspension simulated weightlessness might also promote transition of EC sub cluster 4 to fibroblasts in FA (Additional file 1: Fig. S5).\n\nIn our study, SMCs exhibited heightened transcription ofActa2in both HU CA and HU FA, signifying an increase in alpha SMA levels (Fig.3A, B). This could explain the observed increase in carotid artery intima media thickness in tail suspended rats [5], despite a reduced SMC cell count in HU CA compared to Con CA. Our research also confirmed the increased intima media thickness in HU CA (Fig.3C). The selective upregulation of the ryanodine receptor (Trdn), the voltage dependent L type calcium channel (Cacna1d) andPlnare integral to ER Ca2+homeostasis [20]. The increased expression of these genes indicated a hypercontractile state in HU CA SMCs. The protein level of PLN was verified by immunostaining (Fig.3D). Regarding the ECM, HU CA SMCs showed a decrease in genes encoding elastin (Eln), collagens (Col1a1,Col4a1,Col6a1), laminins (Lamc1,Lamb1,Lama2), thrombospondins (Thbs2,Thbs3), and fibronectin (Fn1) when compared to Con CA. Notably, genes encoding components of the ribosome, such asRpl37andRpl41, were upregulated in HU CA SMCs relative to Con CA. However, a downregulation of genesRps2andRps27awas noted in HU FA compared to Con FA (Fig.3B, Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Additionally, the expression level of genes (Spp1,Msx2,Bmp2) encoding vascular calcification markers (OPN, MSX2, BMP2) were elevated in HU FA compared to Con FA, indicating the tendency of calcification of FA but not CA. Collectively, these results highlighted the heterogeneity between the forebody and hindbody arteries of hindlimb unloaded rats. This was possibly due to differential transmural pressures across the CA and FA as a result of hindlimb unloading [22].\n\nArtery specific transcriptomic changes during hindlimb unloading and sub clusters of SMCs. (A,B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (average log fold change>0.23, average fold change>1.28, P value<0.05) in HU CA SMCs (A) and HU FA SMCs (B) in comparison with Con counterparts.

Scale bar, 40um. *P<0.05\n\nSub clustering analysis of SMCs revealed 6 sub clusters (Fig.3E). Sub cluster 0 was characterized by elevated levels ofCol4a6,Acta2, and glutamine synthetase 2 (Gls2), a regulator of glutaminolysis and ferroptosis. The enriched GO term \"organonitrogen compound metabolic process\" highlighted this sub cluster's metabolic role (Fig.3F). Sub cluster 1 was marked by the presence ofSacsin, encoding a chaperone involved in intermediate filament assembly [23] and the ryanodine receptor 2 (Ryr2), crucial for calcium release and SMC contraction. Sub cluster 2 featured the gene for vitronectin (Vtn), an glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion [24], andHigd1b, which maintains mitochondrial integrity under hypoxia [25]. This sub cluster was more prevalent in the FA than in the CA (Fig.3G). Sub cluster 3 was defined byNdufa4andRps20. NDUFA4 is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism [26].Rps20encodes a ribosomal protein. The sub cluster's contribution to ribosome construction was indicated by the GO terms \"structure constituent of ribosome\" (Fig.3H). The markers of sub cluster 4 are oncofetal geneGpc3and SMCs progenitor markerPi16[27]. According to GSVA (Fig.3I), sub cluster 4 showed enrichment of \"Hedgehog signaling pathway\" which is essential in embryogenesis and a key regulator of stem cell [28,29]. High expression of ECM related genes in this sub cluster, demonstrated by GO enrichment analysis (Fig.3J), heralded that sub cluster 4 was major contributor to the surrounding microenvironmental vascular matrix. The marker of sub cluster 5Esco2is involved in tethering between sister chromatids during DNA double strand break repair [30]. Another markerGas2l3is responsible for linking actin and microtubule filaments in interphase of cells and plays a pivotal role in mitosis and cytokinesis [31]. Consistently, GSVA revealed that \"G2M checkpoint\", \"mitotic spindle signaling pathway\" were enriched in SMCs sub cluster 5. The enrichment of GO term \"cell cycle\" (Fig.3K) and the enrichment of KEGG terms \"DNA replication\" and \"spliceosome\" (Fig.3L) further confirmed the role of this sub cluster in cell cycle. Notably, this sub cluster had a higher percentage of G2 phase cells and a lower percentage of non cycling cells compared to others (Fig.3M). The percentage of sub cluster 4 and 5 in CA and FA was lower after hindlimb unloading (Fig.3G), suggesting that hindlimb unloading may inhibit the cell cycle of SMCs.\n\nThe outer adventitia is predominantly composed of collagen and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts showed the greatest number of both downregulated and upregulated genes in HU group compared to Con counterparts across all clusters (Fig.4A, B), highlighting their high plasticity, which is consistent with previous findings that adventitial plays a pivotal role in vascular remodeling in response to hyperlipidemia or balloon injury [32,33]. As for ECM, an upregulation ofSerpine1andSerpine2(Fig.4C), which encode PAI 1 and PN 1 respectively, indicated heightened antifibrinolytic activity [34] and the limitation in matrix breakdown in HU CA. The upregulation ofNox4andTxnip(Fig.4C, D) may give rise to increased oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation [35] in HU CA and HU FA. The marker of fibroblastPdgfra(Fig.4C, D), which drives fibrosis and proliferation of fibroblast, was upregulated in both HU CA and HU FA. The protein level of TXNIP (Fig.4E), PDGFRalpha and SERPINE2 (Fig.4F) was verified by immunofluorescence. The upregulation of progenitor markerPi16(Fig.4C, D) in HU CA and HU FA suggested the increased progenitor group of fibroblasts [27]. Phenotypic transformation of adventitial fibroblasts, which is characterized by elevated expression ofActa2(Fig.4C, D), is important in the process of vascular diseases [36]. The upregulation ofActa2suggested a shift of fibroblasts towards a myofibroblast phenotype in HU CA and HU FA. GSVA analysis revealed an enrichment of myogenesis related genes in HU CA (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A), hinting at fibroblast involvement in the modulation of intima media thickness during hindlimb unloading. It is worth noting that, following hindlimb unloading exposure, differentially expressed genes were enriched in metabolic process in fibroblast of CA and FA after microgravity according to GO terms analysis (Fig.4G, H).\n\nArtery specific transcriptomic changes during hindlimb unloading and sub clusters of fibroblasts.

(C,D) Immunostaining of PDGFRalpha, TXNIP(C) and SERPINE2 (D) in Con and HU CA.

(G) Heatmap of top 5 marker genes of each fibroblast sub cluster. (H) Go analysis of specific genes in fibroblast sub cluster 1. (I) GSVA analysis of specific genes in each fibroblast sub cluster. Scale bar, 40um\n\nSub clustering analysis of fibroblasts revealed 5 sub clusters (Fig.4I).Col1a1and the glutamate transporterSlc1a3were markers for sub cluster 0. The markers of sub cluster 1Mup5was involved in glucose and lipid metabolism [37]. The enrichment of GO terms (Fig.4J) and GSVA analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B) confirmed this sub cluster's role in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The marker of fibroblast sub cluster 2 includedAlpl, which is involved in vascular calcification, andF2rl1which encoded PAR2, a modulator in vascular inflammation and atherogenesis [38]. Sub cluster 3 maybe progenitor of fibroblast as demonstrated by the expression ofProcr, a signature gene providing stem cell signal in various type of cells [39]. Another markerEfhd1was involved in mitochondrial morphology and energy metabolism in Ca2+dependent and independent manner [40]. The marker of sub cluster 4Spp1is involved in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation [41]. GSVA analysis shows an enrichment of genes associated with angiogenesis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B).\n\nMacrophages are crucial for angiogenesis [42] and the formation of atherosclerosis plaques [43]. The binding of CXCR4 with chemokine CXCL12 activates of mTOR and NF B signaling pathway, which are known to promote cellular growth and proliferation [44]. The upregulation ofCxcr4in macrophages (Fig.5A) and the upregulation ofCxcl12in fibroblasts of HU CA suggested that the interaction of fibroblast CXCL12 with macrophage CXCR4 might be enhanced. The upregulated protein expression of CXCR4 in HU CA was verified through immunofluorescence (Fig.5B). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that upregulated genes (Jund,Nfkbia,Hsp90ab1) were mainly enriched in IL 17 signalling in HU CA and HU FA. The downregulated genes (Cyb,Atp6,Cox2,Nd1,Nd4l,Nd5,Nd6) were mainly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation in HU FA (Fig.5A, D, E).\n\nArtery specific transcriptomic changes of macrophage during hindlimb unloading and some genes that were commonly changed in more than one type of cells.

(D,E) KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes in HU CA macrophages (D) and HU FA macrophages (E) in comparison with Con counterparts. (F,G) Differential gene expression analysis showing the selected up  and down regulated genes across several cell types in HU CA (F) and HU FA (G) compared to their Con counterparts. (H L) Immunostaining of CEPBPB (H), DPT (I), FOSB (J), SPARC (K), KLF4 (L) in Con and HU CA. Scale bar, 40um\n\nThen we scrutinized genes with varying expression levels across multiple cell types to elucidate general vascular remodeling processes (Fig.5F, J). Notably, several TFs were found to be dysregulated.Klf4, which is involved in the mechanotransduction mechanism and up regulates many atheroprotective genes [45], was upregulated in HU CA ECs and fibroblasts as well as in four HU FA cell types. The upregulation ofCebpbandCebpd, which encode the transcription factor C/EBPs, was observed across ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts in HU CA and HU FA, suggesting the possibility of overall inflammatory state [46]. This was further supported by increased levels ofFosbandJun, which encode components of the proinflammatory AP1 transcription factor, in several cell types in both HU CA and HU FA. Additionally, the exclusive downregulation of ECM related genes was observed, consistent with previous report that ECM related genes were downregulated in CA of mice [47]. Specifically,Lox,ElnandDptwere downregulated across HU CA and HU FA endothelial cells, SMCs, and fibroblasts, indicating impaired vascular integrity and elasticity. The downregulation ofcol1a1,col3a1, andSparc, which are involved in collagen binding and maturation, suggests compromised basal lamina assembly and cellular adhesion [48] in CA and FA after hindlimb unloading. Protein level confirmation was obtained for the upregulation of KLF4, FOSB, CEBPB and the downregulation of SPARC, DPT in HU CA. (Fig.5H, I, J, K, L).\n\nIntercellular communication between heterogenous clusters within artery was revealed leveraging CellChatDB. Among HU related changes in ligand receptor pairs in CA and FA, fibroblasts and SMCs played a crucial role in orchestrating intercellular communication changes, as supported by the more pronounced changes in the number of interactions and interaction strength (Fig.6A, B).\n\nThe effect of hindlimb unloading on intercellular communication between different cell types in CA and FA. (A,B) Circle plot showing the differential number of interactions and differential interaction strength among different artery cell types in HU CA (A) and HU FA (B) in comparison with Con counterparts. The red line represented increased number and strength of interaction. The blue line represented the opposite trend. The line thickness is proportional to the number of ligands receptors pairs and interaction strength. (C,D) Heatmap of incoming signaling patterns (C) and outgoing signaling patterns (D) of different cell types identified by CellChat analysis in Con CA and HU CA. (E,F) Heatmap revealing top predicted differential expressed ligand receptor pairs between different cell types in HU CA (E) and HU FA (F) compared to their counterparts\n\nTo elucidate changes in cell to cell communication in the CA due to HU, we utilized CellChat analysis to identify key signaling pathways. This analysis underscored the significant role of fibroblasts and SMCs in cellular communication. Specifically, SMCs received signals fromSpp1,Laminin,Collagen,Fn1, andPtn, while fibroblasts were receptive to signals fromMif,Pdgf, andWnt(Fig.6C). In terms of signal emission, SMCs released signals includingSpp1,Notch, andEphb, whereas fibroblasts secretedCd99,Fn1,Sema3, andIgf(Fig.6D). Then we compared interaction strength between HU CA and Con CA (Fig.6E). For ECM related ligand receptor pairs,Col4a1_Sdc4,Col4a4_Sdc4,Fn1_Itga8/Itgb1,Fn1_Sdc4,Lamb2_Itga7/Itgb1were increased between ECs and SMCs. However, the interactions of ligands includinglama4,lama5,lamb1andlamc1and receptors includingItga7/Itgb1andDag1within SMCs of CA were decreased after HU. In our study, we also assessed the secreted signaling of specific ligand receptor pairs. Notably, the anti inflammatory interaction betweenPros1andAxlwas diminished in the communication between fibroblasts and SMCs after HU in CA [49]. Midkine (Mdk), a heparin binding growth factor involved in cell growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis [50], exhibited reduced interactions from fibroblasts with its transmembrane receptorsLrp1,Ncl,Sdc2, andSdc4on SMCs in HU CA compared to Con CA. These ligand receptor interactions were similarly attenuated within fibroblasts in HU CA. Furthermore, arterial endothelialAckr3, known to mediate endothelium immune cell adhesion [51], showed an increased interaction withMiffrom SMCs in HU CA versus Con CA. The interaction ofMif_Ackr3pair was also enhanced within ECs. Additionally, thePdgfa_Pdgfrbsignaling pair was likewise augmented within SMCs.\n\nHU induced alterations in cellular communication within the FA were also characterized. ECs received signals fromVegf,Cdh5, andJam, while SMCs were responsive toSpp1,Laminin, andSema3(Additional file 1: Fig. S8). Post HU analysis of the FA revealed changes in the interaction strength of specific ligand receptor pairs (Fig.6F). Notably, theSema3c_Plxnd1pair, which suppresses angiogenesis [52], exhibited reduced signaling between fibroblasts and SMCs in HU FA compared to Con FA. In contrast to the CA, the anti inflammatoryPros1_Axlinteraction was enhanced in fibroblast SMC and fibroblast fibroblast communications following HU in the FA. The secreted signaling pairMif_Ackr3was strengthened in SMCs fibroblasts and fibroblasts fibroblasts cell crosstalk. ECM related pairs includingCol1a1_Cd44,Col6a1_ Itga1/Itgb1,Col6a1_Cd44were diminished in fibroblast SMC crosstalk. Unlike in the CA, ECM pairs such asCol1a1_Itga1/Itgb1,Col4a1_Itga1/Itgb1, andCol4a1_Cd44were also reduced in EC SMC communications after HU in the FA. Furthermore, cell cell contact interactions, includingF11r_Jam3,Jag2_Notch1,Jag2_Notch2, andJam2_Jam3, were attenuated in EC SMC crosstalk in HU FA relative to Con FA.\n\nWe performed SCENIC analysis to identify the key TFs responsible for vascular cell heterogeneity and alterations in transcription during HU. We first explored the cluster specific TF regulation features. In a heatmap of average regulon activity, we found thatPrrx2,CebpdandCreb3l1were highlighted in fibroblasts, whileMef2c, crucial for the maturation of smooth muscle cells [53], were exclusively more active in SMCs. SMCs and immune cells showed higher activity of AP 1 family membersJunb,Jund and Fosb(Fig.7A). Subsequently, we discerned differences in regulon activities between the HU and Con groups. The enhanced activity ofMef2awas observed in HU CA compared to Con CA.Ets1, which prevents vascular endothelial injury in diabetes [54], was predicted more active both in CA and FA of rats after HU.\n\nTranscription factor analysis in different cell types of CA and FA. (A,B) Heatmap showing the enrichment of TFs based on normalized AUC values in each cell types (A) and in four groups (B). (C) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within fibroblasts of HU CA and Con CA based on the AUC binary matrix. (D) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within SMCs of HU CA and Con CA based on normalized AUC values. (E) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within ECs of HU CA and Con CA based on the AUC binary matrix. (F) TFs with significantly changed activity and their targeted genes\n\nNext, we studied the differences in TF activity between experimental and control groups within specific cell type. The enhanced activity of inflammation relatedFos,Jun,Cebpbin fibroblast might responsible for vascular remodeling in CA and FA after HU. Compared to the control group, the transcriptional activity ofDdit3, also known asChop, was significantly increased in fibroblasts of the HU group (Fig.7C, Additional file 1: Fig. S9A).Ddit3plays a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and has recently been found to be important in glucose metabolism [55]. This finding may partially explain the observed changes in metabolic pathways in fibroblasts within the HU group as mentioned earlier (Fig.5G, H). As of SMC, transcription factorsFos,Fosb,Srf and Jundexhibited differential expression between the CA and FA, whileMef2cis significantly upregulated in both CA and FA after HU (Fig.7D, Additional file 1: Fig. S9B). Given the pivotal role ofMef2cin smooth muscle differentiation [53], the increased expression ofActa2in HU CA and HU FA might be attributed to the enhanced activity ofMef2c.Zeb1, which is involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition and plays a protective role in the process of atherosclerosis [56], had elevated activities in SMC of HU CA (Fig.7D).Atf4, recognized for its role in angiogenic activation and its ability to heterodimerize with other TFs such asCebpbandJund[57], and AP 1 family memberJunandFos, exhibited greater activity in HU FA and HU CA compared to Con groups in EC. Meanwhile, the atheroprotectiveKlf4demonstrated heightened activity in ECs of HU FA but not HU CA (Fig.7E, Additional file 1: Fig. S9C). Additionally, we constructed the TF target gene network of some TFs and noticed thatJun,Fosb and Mef2cshared some target genes.Acta2is related toSrfandEts1according to this network (Fig.7F), which has enlightening effects on studying the mechanism ofActa2upregulation in several cell types.",
    "discussion": "Weightless environment has a wide range of physiological effects on blood vessels. Here, we present a comprehensive CA and FA cell atlas in rats subjected to hindlimb suspension by utilizing scRNA seq.We observed hindlimb unloading associated alterations in cell type composition. Cell type specific and artery type specific transcriptomic changes were presented. The heterogeneous sub clusters of the major cell types were then identified. In addition, cellular communication and TF prediction in FA and CA of rats under hindlimb unweighting was described. Our study will collectively provide insights into the mechanisms underlying arterial remodeling in microgravity conditions.\n\nThe most frequently reported duration for rat tail suspension is 28 days. However, as human spaceflight missions become increasingly prolonged, it is imperative to observe the physiological effects of long term weightlessness on biological organisms. Consequently, we have extended the duration of rat tail suspension to three months. Using scRNA sequencing method, we delineated 23 distinct cell clusters, representing the predominant cell types within the CA and FA. A comparative analysis between the HU and Con groups revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both the CA and FA after tail suspension. This observation contradicts earlier studies [5], possibly due to variations in the duration of hindlimb suspension, as vascular remodeling is an ongoing and dynamic process. Furthermore, an elevated proportion of immune cells in the HU FA suggests heightened inflammation in the femoral arteries of rats subjected to weightlessness.\n\nConsidering dysregulated genes may be highly specific for different vascular cell types, we provide transcriptomic changes of four major arterial cell types (SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts and macrophages). Notably, fibroblasts from both the CA and FA showed the most significant upregulation and downregulation of genes. This finding underscored their high plasticity and crucial role in vascular remodeling in hindlimb unloaded rats. The adventitial fibroblast's role in vascular remodeling is increasingly recognized [58,59]. However, knowledge about vascular fibroblasts from rats exposed to hindlimb suspension is lacking. ScRNA seq offers an opportunity to detect gene expression of vascular fibroblasts from HU CA and HU FA. The upregulation ofSerpine1andSerpine2suggested impaired matrix degradation in CA and FA after microgravity. Additionally, the heightened expression ofTxnipindicated the elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory state of fibroblasts in HU CA and HU FA. Metabolic processes in adventitial fibroblasts were also found to be altered post hindlimb unloading in the CA and FA, emphasizing the importance of fibroblast metabolic changes in vascular remodeling. This result was consistent with a previous study that highlighted the significant role of metabolic changes in adventitial fibroblasts in the vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterial hypertension in pulmonary hypertension [60].\n\nConsidering the distinct hemodynamics between the upper and lower body, we hypothesized differential gene expression in the FA and CA. Our findings confirmed this, with the CA and FA showing some divergent changes. For instance, genes involved in ribosome subunits were upregulated in HU CA SMCs but downregulated in HU FA SMCs compared to controls. However, we also found some similarities in arterial changes between CA and FA, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to arterial remodeling in addition to headward fluid shift under microgravity. Notably, the expression ofActa2, which encodes alpha SMA, was enhanced in SMCs of both HU CA and HU FA. This, coupled with the reduced proportion of SMCs in the CA and FA, helps us understand the mechanism behind the intima media thickening in HU CA. We speculate that the elevatedActa2expression may predominantly contribute to intima media thickening in the CA, while the decreased SMC fraction in HU FA could counteract the increasedActa2expression. Moreover, the upregulation of inflammation related TFs (Klf4,Fos,Jun,Cebpb) across several cell types, the upregulation ofCxcr4in HU CA and HU FA macrophages, and heightenedTxnipexpression in fibroblasts collectively suggest a possible inflammatory state in the circulatory system of hindlimb unweighted rats. This study reports for the first time the high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the upper and lower body blood vessels under simulated weightlessness. This finding was consistent to previous research showing an inflammatory response in the CA of rats subjected to hindlimb unloading [61]. Similarly, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation have been found elevated in astronauts following long duration spaceflight [62]. Additionally, the downregulation of these genes associated with elastic fibers (Eln), collagens (Col1a1,Col3a1), and other ECM components (Lox,Sparc) in the CA and FA of hindlimb unweighted rats may partially explain the observed decrease in vascular distensibility and the increased vascular stiffness reported previously [2].\n\nAdding another layer of complexity to vascular remodeling in simulated microgravity, heterogeneous cell types exhibited specific features. ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts were extracted from total cells and divided into several sub populations, respectively. Our study revealed two EndoMT related EC sub clusters which were in the process of differentiation into SMCs and fibroblasts. Notably, only EC sub cluster 4 from HU CA was in the process of differentiation into SMCs. This finding was evidenced by the pseudotime analysis. EndoMT is a kind of phenotypic switch through which ECs gain mesenchymal like properties, resulting in enhanced migration and endothelial dysfunction. Inducers of EndoMT include biochemical and biomechanical stimuli [63]. We postulate that elevated transmural pressure in the CA of rats subjected to tail suspension could be a contributing factor. Another possibility is that increased expression ofSerpine1in fibroblasts mediated EndoMT as previously reported [64]. Endothelial impairment was reported during and after spaceflight [65]. The finding of EndoMT in this study may provide new insight of endothelial impairment. Moreover, we found a sub cluster of SMCs responsible for DNA replication and mitosis, indicating the highly proliferative activity of this sub cluster of SMCs.\n\nAs adjacent component of blood vessels, ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts can communicate with each other through direct contact, paracrine and extracellular vesicles [66]. The communication between ECs and VSMCs has been studied intensively. Here we first reported that the number of significantly enriched ligand receptor pairs between SMCs and fibroblasts was more than that between other cell types in HU CA and HU FA. Some studies have found that SMCs interact with fibroblasts in pathological conditions through extracellular vesicles [36,67], highlighting the important role of cellular communication between SMCs and fibroblasts in artery remodeling process. This was also demonstrated in our study. Transcription factor network analysis unraveled the high activity ofFos,Jun,Cebpbin ECs and fibroblasts, indicating the hyperinflammatory state in CA and FA. This finding further suggests the important role of AP 1 family members and CEBPs in vascular remodeling in rats under simulated microgravity.\n\nLimitations of the study lie in the following aspects. First, most of the descriptive results in our study lack proof of protein level although some are verified using immunofluorescent staining. Second, the relatively small number of some cell types such as T and B immune cells and stem cells limits the research of genetic changes in response to simulated microgravity. Third, our study's primary focus was on conduit arteries, namely the CA and FA. The impact of modeled microgravity on microcirculatory changes merits further exploration in future studies.",
    "conclusion": "Comprehensive single cell compendium of the vascular remodeling process in rats at the molecular level under simulated microgravity is described in our study. The identification of region specific and artery specific transcriptomic changes, along with commonalities between the CA and FA, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the vascular remodeling process under microgravity conditions. By focusing on the less explored fibroblasts and immune cells, as well as the sub clusters within the major arterial cell types, our research sheds light on the intricate biological processes at play under simulated microgravity."
