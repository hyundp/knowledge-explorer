    "abstract": "Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic modelC. elegansis a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in theC. elegansmodel since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics based system for strength measurement that we call 'NemaFlex', based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength inC. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.",

    "results": "At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). AsC. elegansthreads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflectionsare quantified using a microscope camera system and image analysis (seeSupplementary Movie 2). The forceFcausing the observed pillar deflection is calculated using the Timoshenko theory for an elastic rod22,34,\n\nIn Eqn.(1),a,h, andIare the diameter, height, and moment of inertia of the cylindrical pillar respectively.Eandgammaare the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar respectively. The point of contact of the worm with the pillar edge is denoted byl = h   (D c)/2, which is calculated knowing the worm diameterDat mid length and the clearancecbetween the pillar edge and the bottom surface of the chamber. The values used for the different parameters inEqn. (1)as well as its validity for force measurement are discussed inSupplementary Note 2.\n\nIn general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics ofC. elegans. Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength.Fig. 4a dshows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red inFig. 4aamong all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame (Fig. 4b). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value (Fig. 4c). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability,f95, as the maximum exertable force (MEF) ofC. elegans(Fig. 4d). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode (Fig. 4b), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 uN in thef95value (c.f.Fig. 3).\n\n(a) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode. The deflected pillars are circled in blue, and the red circle denotes the pillar that experiences the maximum force. Scale bar, 200 um. (b) Variation of maximal force over time due to a worm interacting with pillars (in red). The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm   giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. (c) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. (d) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force,f95, is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability.\n\nOur approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000.Fig. 4cshows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in thef95values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter).\n\nThe purpose of our study is to establish a reliable measure forC. elegansstrength that is equivalent to maximum voluntary force in humans. To achieve this, we sought to identify micropillar forest designs that create high mechanical resistance to locomotion. Analogous to human strength evaluation where strong forces are registered when resistance to motion is high (c.f.Fig. 1a), we expect that animals in tight pillar arenas experience strong resistance to locomotion and produce large forces. Below we show results supporting that animals produce strong forces in highly resistive arenas and discuss the existence of different regimes of resistance to locomotion based on the size of nematode relative to gap between pillars.\n\nTo identify an arena geometry that induces high resistance to locomotion and makesC. elegansproduce maximal forces frequently we fabricated a composite arena (Fig. 5a) that contained three regions (A1, A2, and A3) with distinct pillar diameters (in the range of a  40   60 um) and gap between pillars (s  100   60 um) (Supplementary Note 3). Regions A1, A2 and A3 produced confinement levels ofD/s 0.67, 0.85, and 1.16 for wild type adults respectively (Fig. 5b). The composite arena is unique as it allowed us to investigate the dependence of force velocity correlation and gait parameters on animal confinement.\n\n(a) A composite micropillar arena containing sections A1, A2, and A3 with different pillar spacings to investigate the influence of animal confinement on force generation. Scale bar, 5 mm. (b) The same nematode shown in the three different arenas. The level of confinement (D/s) increases as the worm crawls from arena A1 to A3. Scale bar, 100 um. The force velocity data for animals in (c) A1, (d) A2, and (e) A3 arenas. The lines indicate force velocity cut offs of 80 uN and 600 um/s. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.\n\nPooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), inFig. 5c ewe show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 um/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 uN (Fig. 5c). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 uN (Fig. 5e). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 (Fig. 5d). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate strong confinement regime the force velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait.\n\nFrequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 (Fig. 6).\n\nThe frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.\n\nOur experimental results thus far and previous work in pillar environments22 24,35 38(seeSupplementary Table 2for description of pillar geometries used in prior works), paint the following general picture; depending on the body size and pillar forest geometry,C. eleganslocomotion between microfluidic pillars can be classified as non resistive, moderately resistive or highly resistive. The existence of such regimes has been previously unrecognized.\n\nIn the non resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars (Fig. 7a). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudaret al., where forD/s= 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars38.\n\nThe nematode experiences increasing confinement (D/s) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. (a) Weak resistance,D/s= 0.2, (b) moderate resistance,D/s= 0.6, and (c) strong resistance,D/s= 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted.\n\nIn the moderately resistive regime, frequent contacts with more than two pillars occur (Fig. 7b) and the body wave conveniently fits into the space between pillars; the velocity is high because pillars provide transverse resistance enabling efficient forward locomotion. Forces are moderate because the nematode can fit in the available space with only minor adjustment of body posture. This picture is consistent with our results in A1 arena and further supported by the work of Ryu and coworkers36who showed that whenD/s 0.35   0.5C. elegansswimming speed is enhanced.\n\nIn the highly resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur (Fig. 7c). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johariet al.and Khareet al., who used arenas withD/s= 0.86  1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces23,24.\n\nThe existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior  and gait independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF inC. elegans.\n\nIn this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric ofC. elegansstrength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants.\n\nGiven that even in the highly resistive pillar environments forces fluctuate, we asked whether MEF for the same individual changes due to different degrees of confinement in A1, A2, and A3 arenas. Our hypothesis was that if MEF is truly indicative of the maximum voluntary force then in the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 we should obtain the same values for MEF. InFig. 8a, we show the results for individual wild type animals and find that the MEF in arenas A2 and A3 show a near perfect correlation (f95A2f95A3, calculated slope = 1.01 +/  0.05) while MEF is lower in A1 arena with a slope = 0.46 +/  0.07 shown inFig. 8b. Thusf95is consistent between the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas.\n\nA comparison between maximum exertable forcef95measured for WT individuals in (a) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 +/  0.05, r2= 0.65) and (b) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 +/  0.07, r2=  0.55). A similar comparison is shown forunc 112animals (n=13 individuals) in (c) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 +/  0.04, r2= 0.67) and (d) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 +/  0.07, r2=  0.25). Comparison forlon 2animals (n=10 individuals) in (e) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98+/  0.05, r2= 0.72) and (f) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 +/  0.07, r2= 0.67). The red line is the best fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region.\n\nWe also testedunc 112, a mutant that is weaker due to muscle defects26andlon 2, a mutant that grows approximately 1.5 times longer than wild type. Forunc 112, we find that the correlation of MEF values in arenas A1 and A3 is off from unity (slope = 0.81 +/  0.07), but in A2 and A3 we again observe a near perfect correlation with slope 0.99 +/  0.04 (Fig. 8c, d). We find similar results forlon 2which shows a correlation with slope 0.98 +/  0.05 in arenas A2 and A3 (Fig. 8e, f). Thus, in WT,unc 112andlon 2we obtain consistentf95in the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Previously Johariet al.23and Khareet al.24computed the time average of the pillar forcesfavgto characterizeC. elegansmuscle force. We checked to see how well this measure correlates from the force data of individuals in A1, A2 and A3 arenas. We find thatfavgfrom different arenas are inconsistent in WT animals andunc 112mutant (seeSupplementary Note 4), suggesting thatf95is a much more reliable metric of strength.\n\nThus, our results from the composite arena provide compelling evidence that both the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 maximize force exertion, and our strength metricf95is invariant for a given individual as long as animals are confined to 0.85 <D/s< 1.16. We settled on using A3 arena for the NemaFlex device since maximal forces are more frequent in this arena than A2 arena (Fig. 5d,e) and smaller body sized animals fit better in A3. The actual dimensions of the NemaFlex device are:a= 38.3 um +/  0.4 um,s= 61.7 um +/  2.9 um,h=71.8 +/  2.9 um, with the pillars arranged in a square lattice within a  1 cm2oval shaped arena (Fig. 1b).\n\nIt is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example forC. elegansof different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion.\n\nTo address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal (Fig. 9a d). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long wave or a short wave body posture with the short wave being less frequent (Fig. 9a,b). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown inFig. 9e. We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar:f95(long wave) = 20.98 uN,f95(short wave) = 21.04 uN,f95(reversal) = 22.38 uN, andf95(omega) = 21.32 uN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait.\n\n(a) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WTC. elegansin the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. (b) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that thef95values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs andD/s= 0.87   0.98.\n\nNext, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30 second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f.Fig. 6). We analyzed contiguous images of 30 second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30 second duration) from the full behavioral episode. Thef95of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown inFig. 10a,b. We find that in both contiguous and discrete samplingf95typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown inFig. 3indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short time variation in behavior.\n\n(a) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30 second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85   120 seconds). Data is shown as mean +/  SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10   16%. (b) MEF values obtained from non repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in (a). Data is shown as mean +/  SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. (c) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2 minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30 second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs andD/s= 0.85   0.95.\n\nWe also sampled the behavior of an individual after a long time interval (0, 2, 2.5 hrs), and in this case thef95values change by less than 10% between the three time points (Fig. 10c). Thus, the MEF is also unaffected by long time variation in behavior. Together, these results suggest that sampling a 30 second behavioral episode is sufficient to determine the MEF ofC. elegansand does not rely strongly on the details of behavior. We note that for some mutants it is possible that longer behavioral episodes may need to be tracked to achieve a statistically invariant MEF.\n\nAs an important test to assess whether MEF measure corresponds to the maximum muscular strength, we induced muscle contractions by exposing each animal to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and comparing itsf95scores before and after drug treatment (Fig. 11a). Levamisole is known to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the body wall muscle ofC. elegans, causing prolonged excitation of the muscles, shortening of body length, and eventually paralysis39. As shown inFig. 11b, we indeed observe appreciable reduction in body length due to levamisole exposure (Supplementary Movie 4a & b).\n\n(a) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild typeC. eleganswith 1 mM levamisole. A 60 second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. (b) Levamisole treatment induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 +/  3.2%. (age = 60   84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). (c) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups   60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/  0.06, intercept =  0.006, and r2=0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line representsf95lev+=f95lev (slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95   1.02. (d) Comparison of population level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and threeC. elegansmuscular or neuromuscular mutantsunc 52(n=12, N=14,883 data points),unc 112(n=5, N=2,992 data points), andunc 17(n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85   0.92.\n\nInFig. 11c, we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that thef95value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with thef95score of untreated crawling worms, i.e.f95lev+f95lev (slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 +/  0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 +/  0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 +/  0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength ofC. elegans. It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, thef95after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure.\n\nGiven that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength ofC. elegans, we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutantsunc 112andunc 52, which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively9,40,41. We also tested the mutantunc 17, which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions39,42. In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild type animals (f95=11.92, 16.61, 22.74 uN, and 28.43 uN forunc 112, unc 52, unc 17, and wild type respectively;Fig. 11d), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness.\n\nHarnessing the full capability of NemaFlex for applications ranging from dissecting developmental biology to understanding neuromuscular disorders and aging requires evaluation of howC. elegans' body size affects its muscular strength. For example, individuals from a synchronized culture of WT animals have differences in body size (Supplementary Figure 5), raising the question of whether some animals appear stronger simply because of their larger size. A similar question arises during mutant screenings in which some mutants may be smaller than WT or might develop more slowly than WT and therefore might be smaller at the time of comparison. In aging studies, it is also essential to decouple the strength changes due to frailty from those that might be attributed to animal size, which can change during adult life43.\n\nTo address the influence of body size, we measured the mid body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age matched individuals of WT andlon 2mutants, which are longer than wild type (Fig. 12a d). We find that even though the mean length oflon 2mutants is 1.3 times that of wild type animals (Fig. 12a, b), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different (Fig. 12c), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter (Fig. 12d). The data fit to the scaling relationshipf95~ Dm, withm= 3.32 +/  0.48 and 3.04 +/  0.30 for WT andlon 2animals respectively.\n\n(a) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and alon 2mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 um. (b) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) andlon 2(n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. Thelon 2worms are  1.3 times longer than wild type. (c) The strength distributions of wild type andlon 2worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). (d) Both wild type (n = 94) andlon 2(n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 um. Data shown is mean +/  SD. (e) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 um. (f) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. (g) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles.Tis the muscle tension in the worm,Dis the body diameter,Fis the pillar force andsis the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross sectional area and therefore produce more force.\n\nTo understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero (Fig. 12e, i). These pillar forces are produced byC. elegansdue to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown inFig. 12e, the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle (Fig. 12e, ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation (Fig. 12e, iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter onC. elegans' maximal muscle strength measures.\n\nTo develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F),i.e.M = FxL, where L is the lever arm (Fig. 12f). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = FxL ~ TxD, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body (Fig. 12g). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross sectional area of the muscle (Am) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we haveF ~ AmxD/s. Since Amis proportional to the worm body cross section, i.e.Am~ D2, we finally have\n\nEqn. (2)suggests thatf95should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing.\n\nWe tested the relationF ~ D3, by considering wild type animals of different age and three mutants (Table 2). We find that the data agrees reasonably well with the predicted cubic dependence on worm body diameter in all the tested cases. Interestingly, we observe that even in animals (WT, age = 48, 55 hrs) that have confinement less than our optimal range of 0.85   1.16, the exponent is close to 3. Furthermore, the fact that thef95values of individuals were lower in arena A1, which has larger pillar spacing than arenas A2 and A3 is consistent withEqn. (2). Indeed, we find that the ratios off95in A3 and A1 are approximately inversely proportional to the pillar spacing in the respective arena sections, supporting our simple scaling analysis.\n\nAssessment of scaling of strength with body diameter in wild type and mutant animals.\n\nOur data set shows thatf95~D3and it is possible that deviations from theD3scaling may occur in some mutants or older animals. In such cases deviations fromD3scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system.",
    "discussion": "Basic principle of NemaFlex and force analysis At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push ( Fig. 1c, d ). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections  are quantified using a microscope camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2 ). The force F causing the observed pillar deflection is calculated using the Timoshenko theory for an elastic rod 22 , 34 , F =  ( l 3 3 E I + a 2 ( 1 + gamma ) l 4 E I + l 2 ( h   l ) 2 E I ) (1) In Eqn. (1) , a , h , and I are the diameter, height, and moment of inertia of the cylindrical pillar respectively. E and gamma are the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar respectively. The point of contact of the worm with the pillar edge is denoted by l = h   (D c)/2 , which is calculated knowing the worm diameter D at mid length and the clearance c between the pillar edge and the bottom surface of the chamber. The values used for the different parameters in Eqn. (1) as well as its validity for force measurement are discussed in Supplementary Note 2 . In general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics of C. elegans . Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength. Fig. 4a d shows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red in Fig. 4a among all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame ( Fig. 4b ). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value ( Fig. 4c ). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability, f 95 , as the maximum exertable force (MEF) of C. elegans ( Fig. 4d ). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode ( Fig. 4b ), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 uN in the f 95 value (c.f. Fig. 3 ). Figure 4. Data analysis workflow for NemaFlex strength measurement. Open in a new tab ( a ) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode.

The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm   giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. ( c ) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. ( d ) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force, f 95 , is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability. Our approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000. Fig. 4c shows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in the f 95 values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter).\n\nResistance to locomotion in the pillar arena determines maximal forces The purpose of our study is to establish a reliable measure for C. elegans strength that is equivalent to maximum voluntary force in humans. To achieve this, we sought to identify micropillar forest designs that create high mechanical resistance to locomotion. Analogous to human strength evaluation where strong forces are registered when resistance to motion is high ( c.f. Fig. 1a ), we expect that animals in tight pillar arenas experience strong resistance to locomotion and produce large forces. Below we show results supporting that animals produce strong forces in highly resistive arenas and discuss the existence of different regimes of resistance to locomotion based on the size of nematode relative to gap between pillars. Highly resistive pillar environment is characterized by low velocity and strong forces To identify an arena geometry that induces high resistance to locomotion and makes C. elegans produce maximal forces frequently we fabricated a composite arena ( Fig. 5a ) that contained three regions (A1, A2, and A3) with distinct pillar diameters (in the range of a  40   60 um) and gap between pillars (s  100   60 um) ( Supplementary Note 3 ). Regions A1, A2 and A3 produced confinement levels of D / s  0.67, 0.85, and 1.16 for wild type adults respectively ( Fig. 5b ). The composite arena is unique as it allowed us to investigate the dependence of force velocity correlation and gait parameters on animal confinement. Figure 5. Resistance to locomotion determines maximal forces. Open in a new tab ( a ) A composite micropillar arena containing sections A1, A2, and A3 with different pillar spacings to investigate the influence of animal confinement on force generation. Scale bar, 5 mm. ( b ) The same nematode shown in the three different arenas. The level of confinement ( D / s ) increases as the worm crawls from arena A1 to A3. Scale bar, 100 um. The force velocity data for animals in ( c ) A1, ( d ) A2, and ( e ) A3 arenas. The lines indicate force velocity cut offs of 80 uN and 600 um/s. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours. Pooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), in Fig. 5c e we show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 um/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 uN ( Fig. 5c ). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 uN ( Fig. 5e ). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 ( Fig. 5d ). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate strong confinement regime the force velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait. Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 ( Fig. 6 ). Figure 6. Behavioral phenotyping of C. elegans in pillar arenas with different confinements. Open in a new tab The frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours. Identification of different regimes of resistance to locomotion Our experimental results thus far and previous work in pillar environments 22   24 , 35   38 (see Supplementary Table 2 for description of pillar geometries used in prior works), paint the following general picture; depending on the body size and pillar forest geometry, C. elegans locomotion between microfluidic pillars can be classified as non resistive, moderately resistive or highly resistive. The existence of such regimes has been previously unrecognized. In the non resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars ( Fig. 7a ). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudar et al. , where for D / s = 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars 38 . Figure 7. Schematic illustrating the effect of animal confinement on mechanical resistance and force generation in pillar environments. Open in a new tab The nematode experiences increasing confinement ( D / s ) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. ( a ) Weak resistance, D / s = 0.2, ( b ) moderate resistance, D / s = 0.6, and ( c ) strong resistance, D / s = 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted. In the moderately resistive regime, frequent contacts with more than two pillars occur ( Fig. 7b ) and the body wave conveniently fits into the space between pillars; the velocity is high because pillars provide transverse resistance enabling efficient forward locomotion. Forces are moderate because the nematode can fit in the available space with only minor adjustment of body posture. This picture is consistent with our results in A1 arena and further supported by the work of Ryu and coworkers 36 who showed that when D / s  0.35   0.5 C. elegans swimming speed is enhanced. In the highly resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur ( Fig. 7c ). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johari et al. and Khare et al. , who used arenas with D / s = 0.86  1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces 23 , 24 . The existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior  and gait independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF in C. elegans .\n\nMaximum exertable force f 95 is a reliable measure to score muscle strength in C. elegans In this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric of C. elegans strength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants. Optimized pillar arena produces consistent readout of MEF Given that even in the highly resistive pillar environments forces fluctuate, we asked whether MEF for the same individual changes due to different degrees of confinement in A1, A2, and A3 arenas. Our hypothesis was that if MEF is truly indicative of the maximum voluntary force then in the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 we should obtain the same values for MEF. In Fig. 8a , we show the results for individual wild type animals and find that the MEF in arenas A2 and A3 show a near perfect correlation ( f 95 A 2  f 95 A 3 , calculated slope = 1.01 +/  0.05) while MEF is lower in A1 arena with a slope = 0.46 +/  0.07 shown in Fig. 8b . Thus f 95 is consistent between the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Figure 8. Highly resistive pillar arenas produce consistent maximum exertable force. Open in a new tab A comparison between maximum exertable force f 95 measured for WT individuals in ( a ) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 +/  0.05, r 2 = 0.65) and ( b ) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 +/  0.07, r 2 =  0.55). A similar comparison is shown for unc 112 animals (n=13 individuals) in ( c ) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 +/  0.04, r 2 = 0.67) and ( d ) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 +/  0.07, r 2 =  0.25). Comparison for lon 2 animals (n=10 individuals) in ( e ) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98+/  0.05, r 2 = 0.72) and ( f ) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 +/  0.07, r 2 = 0.67). The red line is the best fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region. We also tested unc 112 , a mutant that is weaker due to muscle defects 26 and lon 2 , a mutant that grows approximately 1.5 times longer than wild type. For unc 112 , we find that the correlation of MEF values in arenas A1 and A3 is off from unity (slope = 0.81 +/  0.07), but in A2 and A3 we again observe a near perfect correlation with slope 0.99 +/  0.04 ( Fig. 8c, d ). We find similar results for lon 2 which shows a correlation with slope 0.98 +/  0.05 in arenas A2 and A3 ( Fig. 8e, f ). Thus, in WT, unc 112 and lon 2 we obtain consistent f 95 in the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Previously Johari et al. 23 and Khare et al. 24 computed the time average of the pillar forces f avg to characterize C. elegans muscle force. We checked to see how well this measure correlates from the force data of individuals in A1, A2 and A3 arenas. We find that f avg from different arenas are inconsistent in WT animals and unc 112 mutant (see Supplementary Note 4 ), suggesting that f 95 is a much more reliable metric of strength. Thus, our results from the composite arena provide compelling evidence that both the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 maximize force exertion, and our strength metric f 95 is invariant for a given individual as long as animals are confined to 0.85 < D / s < 1.16. We settled on using A3 arena for the NemaFlex device since maximal forces are more frequent in this arena than A2 arena ( Fig. 5d,e ) and smaller body sized animals fit better in A3. The actual dimensions of the NemaFlex device are: a = 38.3 um +/  0.4 um, s = 61.7 um +/  2.9 um, h =71.8 +/  2.9 um, with the pillars arranged in a square lattice within a  1 cm 2 oval shaped arena ( Fig. 1b ). It is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example for C. elegans of different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion. MEF is independent of locomotory gait To address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal ( Fig. 9a d ). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long wave or a short wave body posture with the short wave being less frequent ( Fig. 9a,b ). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown in Fig. 9e . We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar: f 95 (long wave) = 20.98 uN, f 95 (short wave) = 21.04 uN, f 95 (reversal) = 22.38 uN, and f 95 (omega) = 21.32 uN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait. Figure 9. NemaFlex quantitates maximum exertable force independent of C. elegans gait. Open in a new tab ( a ) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WT C. elegans in the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. ( b ) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that the f 95 values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs and D / s = 0.87   0.98. MEF is insensitive to time variation of behavior Next, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30 second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f. Fig. 6 ). We analyzed contiguous images of 30 second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30 second duration) from the full behavioral episode. The f 95 of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown in Fig. 10a,b . We find that in both contiguous and discrete sampling f 95 typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown in Fig. 3 indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short time variation in behavior. Figure 10. Maximum exertable force is independent of C. elegans behavior in the NemaFlex pillar arena. Open in a new tab ( a ) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30 second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85   120 seconds). Data is shown as mean +/  SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10   16%. ( b ) MEF values obtained from non repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in ( a ). Data is shown as mean +/  SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. ( c ) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2 minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30 second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs and D / s = 0.85   0.95. We also sampled the behavior of an individual after a long time interval (0, 2, 2.5 hrs), and in this case the f 95 values change by less than 10% between the three time points ( Fig. 10c ). Thus, the MEF is also unaffected by long time variation in behavior. Together, these results suggest that sampling a 30 second behavioral episode is sufficient to determine the MEF of C. elegans and does not rely strongly on the details of behavior. We note that for some mutants it is possible that longer behavioral episodes may need to be tracked to achieve a statistically invariant MEF. MEF before and after drug induced muscle contractions is the same As an important test to assess whether MEF measure corresponds to the maximum muscular strength, we induced muscle contractions by exposing each animal to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and comparing its f 95 scores before and after drug treatment ( Fig. 11a ). Levamisole is known to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the body wall muscle of C. elegans , causing prolonged excitation of the muscles, shortening of body length, and eventually paralysis 39 . As shown in Fig. 11b , we indeed observe appreciable reduction in body length due to levamisole exposure ( Supplementary Movie 4a & b ). Figure 11. NemaFlex quantitates maximum muscular strength in C. elegans . Open in a new tab ( a ) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild type C. elegans with 1 mM levamisole. A 60 second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. ( b ) Levamisole treatment induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 +/  3.2%. (age = 60   84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). ( c ) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups   60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/  0.06, intercept =  0.006, and r 2 =0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line represents f 95 lev+ = f 95 lev  (slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95   1.02. ( d ) Comparison of population level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and three C. elegans muscular or neuromuscular mutants unc 52 (n=12, N=14,883 data points), unc 112 (n=5, N=2,992 data points), and unc 17 (n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85   0.92. In Fig. 11c , we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that the f 95 value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with the f 95 score of untreated crawling worms, i.e. f 95 lev+  f 95 lev  (slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 +/  0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 +/  0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 +/  0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength of C. elegans . It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, the f 95 after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure. MEF detects muscle strength weakness in mutants Given that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength of C. elegans , we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutants unc 112 and unc 52 , which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively 9 , 40 , 41 . We also tested the mutant unc 17 , which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions 39 , 42 . In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild type animals ( f 95 =11.92, 16.61, 22.74 uN, and 28.43 uN for unc 112, unc 52, unc 17 , and wild type respectively; Fig. 11d ), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness.\n\nInfluence of body size on muscular strength in C. elegans Harnessing the full capability of NemaFlex for applications ranging from dissecting developmental biology to understanding neuromuscular disorders and aging requires evaluation of how C. elegans ' body size affects its muscular strength. For example, individuals from a synchronized culture of WT animals have differences in body size ( Supplementary Figure 5 ), raising the question of whether some animals appear stronger simply because of their larger size. A similar question arises during mutant screenings in which some mutants may be smaller than WT or might develop more slowly than WT and therefore might be smaller at the time of comparison. In aging studies, it is also essential to decouple the strength changes due to frailty from those that might be attributed to animal size, which can change during adult life 43 . Muscular strength depends strongly on body diameter but not length To address the influence of body size, we measured the mid body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age matched individuals of WT and lon 2 mutants, which are longer than wild type ( Fig. 12a d ). We find that even though the mean length of lon 2 mutants is 1.3 times that of wild type animals ( Fig. 12a, b ), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different ( Fig. 12c ), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter ( Fig. 12d ). The data fit to the scaling relationship f 95 ~ D m , with m = 3.32 +/  0.48 and 3.04 +/  0.30 for WT and lon 2 animals respectively. Figure 12. Influence of body size on C. elegans muscle strength. Open in a new tab ( a ) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and a lon 2 mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 um. ( b ) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) and lon 2 (n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. The lon 2 worms are  1.3 times longer than wild type. ( c ) The strength distributions of wild type and lon 2 worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). ( d ) Both wild type (n = 94) and lon 2 (n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 um. Data shown is mean +/  SD. ( e ) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 um. ( f ) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. ( g ) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles. T is the muscle tension in the worm, D is the body diameter, F is the pillar force and s is the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross sectional area and therefore produce more force. To understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero ( Fig. 12e, i ). These pillar forces are produced by C. elegans due to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown in Fig. 12e , the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle ( Fig. 12e , ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation ( Fig. 12e , iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter on C. elegans ' maximal muscle strength measures. A biomechanics model explains D 3 scaling To develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F), i.e. M = FxL, where L is the lever arm ( Fig. 12f ). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = FxL ~ TxD, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body ( Fig. 12g ). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross sectional area of the muscle (A m ) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we have F ~ A m xD/s . Since A m is proportional to the worm body cross section, i.e. A m ~ D 2 , we finally have F ~ D 3 / s (2) Eqn. (2) suggests that f 95 should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing. We tested the relation F ~ D 3 , by considering wild type animals of different age and three mutants ( Table 2 ). We find that the data agrees reasonably well with the predicted cubic dependence on worm body diameter in all the tested cases. Interestingly, we observe that even in animals (WT, age = 48, 55 hrs) that have confinement less than our optimal range of 0.85   1.16, the exponent is close to 3. Furthermore, the fact that the f 95 values of individuals were lower in arena A1, which has larger pillar spacing than arenas A2 and A3 is consistent with Eqn. (2) . Indeed, we find that the ratios of f 95 in A3 and A1 are approximately inversely proportional to the pillar spacing in the respective arena sections, supporting our simple scaling analysis. Table 2.

In such cases deviations from D 3 scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system.",
    "conclusion": "C. elegansis a powerful genetic model with conserved muscle biology, and over the last few decades new insights have been gained into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle that are usually applicable to all animals. Kinematic measures, for example swim frequency or crawling speed, derived from locomotory assays have been typically used to assess neuromuscular function inC. elegans44. More recently, propulsive forces have been determined by tracking velocity fields and body kinematics during swimming45by challenging worms to swim up inclined surfaces46and by measuring drag coefficients of crawling animals47.\n\nIn a parallel effort, building on advances in microfluidics48, important attempts for measuring forces generated by movingC. eleganshave been made using piezoresistance sensors20and deformable pillars22 26. However, these prior efforts reported forces that vary depending on pillar arena geometry, worm velocity, and body posture;thus, none of these yields a maximum force that is independent of animal behavior and accounts for variations in animal size. Without a behavior  and size independent strength measurement, it is difficult to standardize muscle force investigations inC. elegans.\n\nHere we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force inC. elegans. To confirm that NemaFlex indeed reports behavior independent strength, we evaluated different pillar spacings and duration of behavioral episodes and showed that animals push as hard as they can once they reach a certain level of confinement; a behavioral episode as low as 30 seconds is sufficient to capture a statistically invariant MEF for young adults. The force measures before and after levamisole induced full muscle contractions were found to be similar, which supports our metric of maximum force. Indeed, the levamisole experiment shows thatC. elegansMEF is similar to human MVF   a critical advance for the ability to compare experimental data across muscle studies.\n\nRecognizing that animals from the same culture might have different body sizes or that mutations may cause variation in body size, we investigated the influence of body size on MEF. We showed that MEF is independent of the body length, but it strongly depends on body diameter. Importantly, we uncovered a relationship of strength withC. elegansdiameter that is consistent with a scaling analysis in which bending moments due to maximum external force and internal muscle tension balance each other. Thus, we have produced a compensation factor for body size that enables animals of different age, genetic makeup, or experience to be fairly compared.\n\nIn humans, relative strength is a compelling indicator of muscle homeostasis, physical training, and disease. As we model these conditions in invertebrates, there is a critical need to establish standardized measures of strength that have relevance in human muscle physiology. The NemaFlex technology addresses this gap by providing a robust analog of MVF in vertebrates. With current throughput of strength evaluation being ~10 min/worm (loading, imaging, image analysis, and validation), the NemaFlex system is well equipped for targeted investigations on disease conditions that can be modeled inC. elegans. High throughput genetic and drug screens are also possible with NemaFlex, although this would require further microfluidic automation and parallelized analysis. At a more fundamental level, NemaFlex may help in defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function49."
