    "abstract": "The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organismArabidopsis thalianagrown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col) 0, and mutant phytochromeD (phyD) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide diphospho sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.\n\nKeywords:gene expression, graphs, network analysis, root growth, cell wall biosynthesis, spaceflight microgravity,Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "methods": "We have mined GeneLab GLDS 7 and GLDS  120 datasets for identifying hub genes that are affected by spaceflight. The GLDS 7 dataset contains microarray gene expression data for theArabidopsisWS and Col 0 ecotypes for different tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) for the plants grown in ground control and spaceflight in white light. GLDS 120 contains the transcriptomics data of theArabidopsisWassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col 0) ecotypes, and the genePhytochrome D(phyD) mutant of ecotype Col 0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are 4 6 umoles m 2 s 1 of total light and dark in spaceflight and on the ground. The design of the experiment was to investigate the effect of light onArabidopsisroot growth when the gravity stimuli were nullified. ThephyDmutant was used, since it is a known light related mutant in Col 0 background. RNAseq is used for transcription profiling. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes.\n\nWe define a graph based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G = (V, E) where V is the vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and E is an ordered pair of vertices (u, v) that are called the edges (arcs), respectively [30]. One important advantage of the representation of networks by graphs is that they have an intuitive graphical representation. In a directed graph G = (V, E, o, t), e = (u, v) are the edges, the origin of e is denoted by o(e), and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a positive real valued weight w(e). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is applied to de correlate the gene expression values. PCA is done to reduce the dimensions to three main components corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix computed from the graph representation of the gene expression data. PCA projects the data on to an orthogonal space, such that the variance of the projected data is maximized. This space is lower in dimension with minimum projection cost. PCA is applied to the gene expression datasets before performing both LASSO regression and Pearson correlation GRN construction.\n\nLasso is a linear regression algorithm that shrinks the data towards a central point. Lasso regression mostly leads to sparse models. Lasso uses thel1regularization, which means it adds a penalty that is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients. Lasso regression is computationally feasible and can fit any kind of statistical data [31].l1regularization is applied to eliminate the relationship between the genes with the least importance. The Lasso regression is constructed according to the description in [31]. We have used the SILGGM package in R for the Lasso Regression [32]. In this algorithm, every gene present in the data is considered as a transcription factor, as well as a target gene, and the correlation between each gene with the other is calculated using the scaled Lasso algorithm. The results from the regression are used to construct GRNs in Cytoscape for the sub modules of the genes ofArabidopsisspaceflight and ground datasets. The method has been applied to the GeneLab GLDS 120 dataset.\n\nPearson's correlation coefficient between two genes (variables, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations:\n\nPearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two random variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not specifically identified. In this study, we use the Pearson correlation to construct the co expressed gene network to identify genes with correlated expression patterns. This method is based on an adjusted thresholdp value to accommodate multiple hypotheses; the correlation between expression patterns is calculated for every pair of genes. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between  1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered to be co expressed if theirp value is less than or equal to the corrected thresholdp value. Thet test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and hence, that there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the nodes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intra module (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks.Figure 1shows the steps involved in generating the GRN from the microarray gene expression dataset using this method.\n\nFlow chart of the procedure for gene regulatory network inferencing using the graph based Pearson correlation method.\n\nWe show that the GRN generated for the GeneLabArabidopsisdatasets are sparse networks or graphs. We define sparsity precisely so that we utilize quantitatively time and speedups in HITS and other algorithms. Briefly, we recall the following definitions obtained from [30] and [33].\n\nDirected graph: The graph (V, E, o, t) is said to be directed if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph, G = (V, E, o, t), the edges e = (u, v), the origin of e is denoted by o, and the terminal v is denoted by t(v).\n\nBipartite graph: The graph is calledbipartiteifV=V1V2such that edges connect nodeV1toV2. The expanding constant or isoperimetric constant (or Cheeger constant) ofXis defined as:\n\nwhereFVand the boundaryFis the set of edges connectingFtoVF. The isoperimetric constant is difficult to compute, but we can bound its value using the spectral gap. The Spectral Gap is defined as the difference between the two highest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph.\n\nSparse graphs: We say that a graph (or the corresponding network) is sparse ifhXis large. One of the major results of Cheeger for Riemannian manifolds and its equivalent for graphs is that a large spectral gap implies largehX.ComputinghXis an NP Complete problem, while the computing spectral gap is at most cubic and many times linear; we work with the spectral gap here.\n\nSpectral gap: For a graph X, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as |1| >= |2| >=    >= |n| (X may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The spectral gap is defined as: = |1|   |2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of X, the eigenvalues are 1 = 1>= 2>=    >= n > 0, and the Lapacian spectral gap will be: =1   |2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept 2is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, 2= 1 ( is not (strongly) connected or  is bipartite), and a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence; the larger the spectral gap (the smaller |2|), the better the network flow (largehX, diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network X).\n\nGirth: The girth ofXis the smallest positive integerrsuch thatTraceAr>0. Letd=dXbe the smallest integer (if it exists), so that for every pair of verticesu,v, there is a walk of length at mostdfromutov. Then,dXis called the diameter or maximum eccentricity of the graphX.\n\nClustering coefficient: The clustering coefficient models the degree of clustering of a subset of nodes. A node is selected, and we see how connected the node is with other nodes that are also connected to it. The clustering coefficient is defined by:\n\nwhereLiis the number of connections betweenKi, which are the immediate neighbors of nodei. The clustering coefficient is used to characterize network modularity, which is a strength of measure of a network division into modules or groups.\n\nDegree distribution: The degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of a nodeiis the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix:\n\nwhere the sum is over all the nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. For this case, the sum of theith rows andith columns of the adjacency matrix are:\n\nThe degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degreekinandkout.\n\nBiomolecular networks such as GRNs follow preferential attachment models, which are scale free with a degree distribution that follows an exponential law. Unlike the random graph model, these networks have nodes with large degrees, called hubs. Classically, with 0 1 (nonconnection connection) networks, just the degree distribution is used in the identification of such hubs. A much more sophisticated algorithm is proposed by Kleinberg [34], called the HITS algorithm. Originally, it was meant for networks such as the Internet; however, now, it is used to study a variety of biomolecular networks, such as GRNs and Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) networks [35,36]. Most of these applications use PageRank to reveal localized information about the graph based on some form of external data. We apply this algorithm in our setting for the weighted and directed networks for the transcription factors target gene networks and for co expression networks.\n\nIn the weighted GRN setting, the traditional simplistic method of detecting hub genes would not yield meaningful information. Our approach uses iteratively the weighted HITS algorithm in a novel way as follows. The weighted HITS algorithm computes the hubhk(resp. authorityak)nodesiteratively as:hk=kk 1AAThk 2andak=kk 1ATAak 2. These iterations converge to the dominant eigenvector of the real symmetric matricesAAT(ATA). These give us asymptotically hub and authority weights. A version of this algorithm is implemented and applied to the networks in the software SAGE. Our algorithm gives weighted hub genes and weighted authority (target) genes. In complex networks, the HITS algorithm has very high complexity, and cannot be applied successfully. The spectral gap analysis shows that the graphs are sparse but highly connected, helping us carry out HITS with a high degree of iterations. The weighted HITS algorithm has yielded important information about biomolecular networks [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. For network topology, we refer to [46], and for the latest on the origin of biomolecular networks, topological, combinatorial, and spectral methods, we refer to [47].",
    "results": "The Pearson correlation method is used to generate weighted directed graphs. Two columns of 20,000 samples of gene expression values of Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col 0 root growth in spaceflight from GLDS 7 and GLDS 120 datasets are plotted inFigure 2(A) and (B), respectively.X axis is the first column of the gene expression values andy axis is the second column of the gene expression values. The plot shows that the values are highly correlated. Hence, PCA is first applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data to three dimensions. The three PCA components are then used for computing Pearson correlation and generating the network, as explained inSection 2.2.2. All the gene expression values from GLDS 7 and GLDS 120 spaceflight and ground data for Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth are used for generating the networks. InTable 1, sample correlation values between 13 genes, their t statistics, and theirp values are given. Correlation values range from  1 to 1.P values can also be used to construct GRNs by thresholding them between, for example, 0.01, and 0.0001, which will give the same network as a correlation threshold of 0.05. The threshold can be adjusted depending on the required level of complexity of the inferenced GRN.Figure 3andFigure 4show sub graphs extracted from GLDS 7 root growth spaceflight and ground gene expression data, respectively, with a correlation threshold of 0.05. This threshold selects 11.3% of genes from the GLDS 7 dataset and 28.7% genes from the GLDS 120 dataset. These are weighted and directed sub graphs extracted from the GLDS 7 spaceflight and ground GRNs, respectively. The weights are the correlation values (positive and negative) between the hub gene and the target gene, shown inFigure 3andFigure 4. Negative interactions are important because they show an activation inhibition two way expression pattern. While positive correlations indicate shifting, scaling, or geometric pattern in gene expression data, negative correlations indicate opposite and complementary expression patterns, and self negative regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Hence, we have extracted both maximal positive and negative correlations for constructing the GRNs. These gene interactions have not been validated by follow up experiments; however, they have been constructed from gene expression data obtained originally from experiments conducted in the ISS.\n\n(A) Plot of gene expression values forArabidopsis thalianaWS root growth in spaceflight microgravity from GLDS 7 dataset.

This helps us to make a secondary comparison between Col 0 ecotype with its mutantphyDand shows which hub genes are significantly represented in either case. Among the Arabidopsis ecotypes grown in spaceflight light environments, the GRN of Col 0 mutantphyDhas 20 hub genes that are not shared with GRN of Col 0 ecotype grown in the same environment. The hub genes of Col 0 mutantphyDGRN overlap lesser with those of Col 0 than the overlap of the hub genes between WS and Col 0 GRNs in the light environment. The GRN of Col 0 mutantphyDin spaceflight light environment has the lowest number of shared hub genes. ThephyDgene has a role in Red/Far Red Light Sensing [48]. From our network analysis, we see that manipulation of a gene in an Arabidopsis ecotype can result in significantly different transcriptomic response that makes the biological organism to better adapt to the spaceflight environment [20].\n\nVenn diagrams showing the number of shared hub genes from the gene regulatory networks forArabidopsis thaliana. (A) Between the WS and Col 0 ecotypes in spaceflight and ground control for both total light and dark environments. (B) Between Col 0 ecotype and Col 0 mutantphyDin spaceflight and ground control for both total light and dark environments.\n\nFigure 6shows the Pearson correlation gene regulatory sub graphs extracted from GRNs of the GLDS 120 dataset for the catabolic process for the Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth in spaceflight light environment. The number of hub genes in the GRN representation can be controlled by suitably adjusting the threshold value. The lower the threshold, larger number of hub genes can be detected and vice versa. In all our networks, we have used a nominal correlation threshold value of 0.05. The original networks have more than 600 genes involved in regulatory pathways. The GSEA of these hub genes present in spaceflight microgravity and ground control GRNs for WS, Col 0, and Col mutantphyDecotypes grown in different light environments are presented below.\n\nGene regulatory sub graph for the catabolic process inArabidopsis thalianaCol 0 mutantphyDin spaceflight total light environment. The hub genes are the red circles representing the strong interactions with differentially expressed genes. The target (authority) genes are white circles.\n\nThe hub genes, shared genes for spaceflight and ground environments, and their gene ontology from the GeneLab GLDS 7 root growth datasets are given inTable 2. The ShinyGO tool (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/, accessed on 5 February 2021) is used to perform GSEA of the hub genes for the GeneLab GLDS 7 root growth GRN. The hub genes for spaceflight microgravity and ground overlap considerably and are involved in molecular functions, biological processes, and oxidation reduction process. They enable NADH dehydrogenase activity, and are involved in NAD and quinone binding. Contrary to GLDS 7 GRN functions, the GRNs constructed for theArabidopsisWS, Col 0, and Col mutantphyDshow significantly different regulations in spaceflight in total light. These GRNs do share genes with ground control GRNs, but have other genes that show significant transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity, and these genes are not shared by the ground GRNs. Hence, these genes can be considered to be affected by spaceflight microgravity alone. These genes are related to biological processes such as DNA integration, the RNA dependent DNA biosynthetic process, and the DNA metabolic process. We performed a GSEA analysis comparing hub genes for the WS wild ecotype and Col 0 ecotype. The hub genes for the WS ecotype are associated with biological processes such as the catabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, localization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The hub genes for the Col 0 ecotype perform similar functions to WS ecotype such as the catabolic process, regulation of metabolic process, positive regulation of biological process, cellular response to stimulus, signaling, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The shared hub genes between the Col 0 ecotype and Col 0 mutantphyDperform functions such as regulation of metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, positive regulation of biological process, anatomical structure development, and catabolic process. The non shared hub genes ofphyDin spaceflight microgravity perform significant functions such as the cellular component organization of biogenesis, response to abiotic stress, and response to external stimulus.\n\nHub genes from the Pearson Correlation GRN and HITS method and shared hub genes for GLDS 7 forArabidopsis thalianaroot growth in spaceflight and ground control with their gene ontology.\n\nEight common hub genes between the spaceflight and ground environments have been identified, as shown inTable 2. Using g:Profiler, we found that these genes, including the gene ATMG00600 (ORF 106C), are uncharacterized mitochondrial protein and their function is DNA integration. AT1G04080 is a shared gene between the Col 0 and WS ecotypes, which encodes a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factor involved in alternative splicing. AT1G02930 and AT1G04980 are the shared genes between the Col 0 and Col 0 mutantphyD, which are involved in the defense response to bacterium, glutathione metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, response to oxidative stress, water deprivation, heat, response to unfolded protein, and ubiquitin pathway. The Pearson and LASSO methods have led to the identification of signature sub networks that show the interaction across several important metabolic and signaling processes, and Transcription Factors (TFs) forArabidopsisgrowth in spaceflight microgravity. Both methods were able to identify the transcription factors AT1G06040, AT1G01720, and AT1G04850. AT1G06040 encodes salt tolerance protein and AT1G01720 is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and has a DNA binding TF activity. The TF AT1G04850 is a ubiquitin associated (UBA)/TS N domain containing protein, and its function is zinc ion binding. From the GRNs, we can identify genes with the maximum degree (hub genes) that regulate a larger number of authority (target) genes.\n\nThirty eight hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight have been identified from the total light environment gene expression datasets of GLDS 120. Their ATG number, gene name, and gene ontology are presented inSupplementary Table S1. These are hub genes, as their transcriptional responses are abundant only in spaceflight microgravity network and are not found to be hub genes in the corresponding terrestrial GRNs. Hence, these genes are functioning only in spaceflight microgravity conditions. From their ontology, it is evident that they are responsible for important functions necessary for the plant's growth in an altered environmental setup compared to the terrestrial environment. The plant can sense the changes in abiotic stressors such as gravity, oxygen, and radiation and can step up transcriptional regulation to adapt to the new environment successfully. The transcription functions of these genes are chiefly cell wall biosynthesis, protein transport, stress responses, catabolic processes, auxin, and protein regulation. It is also significant that these genes were identifiable only from the GLDS 120 dataset, which had a different lighting environment in spaceflight. Through novel graph theoretic methods applied to GRNs ofArabidopsis, we can explain phenomenological traits that have been observed in spaceflight vis  vis on the ground.\n\nTopological and algebraic analyses of the GRNs are given inTable 3. The WS ecotype in total light spaceflight environment has the largest spectral gap, which indicates that this network has the highest performance with stable synchronization, rapid convergence, mixing, expansion, and diffusion [47]. Random walks propagate more easily in networks with a large spectral gap. The large spectral gap has also made several algorithms we use tractable for such massively large GRN and indicates that in technical terms, these GRNs are highly sparse. This corroborates with results from other studies that have shown that the WS genotype increases the transcriptional cost of spaceflight adaptation [20]. The diameter of this network is 6, indicating that it has longer gene signaling pathways, and the hub genes of this network regulate about 1000 target genes. The WS and Col 0 ecotypes in the ground light environment show topological similarities with the same shortest path length, and the two networks show regulation of about 45 target genes.\n\nTopological and spectral analysis forArabidopsis(AT) spaceflight and ground gene regulatory networks.\n\nWe show, with our spectral analysis methods, through the spectral estimates on the Cheeger constant that our networks are sparse, that the HITS algorithm works much faster, and we have been able to identify hubs and authority nodes (genes) in the networks. Rather than just the degree distribution, hubs and authority nodes are computed iteratively with newer algorithms considering weights using its implementation in the software SAGEMATH. Improved algorithms exist, e.g., [35], and some of Kleinberg's works.\n\nOut of the 33 root growth related genes ofArabidopsis, we have identified five significant hub genes listed inTable 4to have higher regulations in spaceflight.Figure 7shows the subgraph that is extracted from the original Pearson correlation GRN by thresholding the genes with higher correlation values and involved in the cell wall biosynthesis metabolic process that relates the co expression of these genes in spaceflight microgravity for theArabidopsisCol mutantphyDecotype. These five hub genes have higher regulations only in the spaceflight subgraph for the cell wall response process and not in the ground subgraph. These genes are over represented in the spaceflight responsive transcriptome because they regulate plant growth in spaceflight microgravity and enable adaptation of the plant to the altered environment. Similarly, comparing the GRNs generated by the LASSO method forArabidopsisWS ecotype in spaceflight and ground environments, the hub genes that are involved only in spaceflight for cell wall biosynthesis have been identified and listed inSupplementary Table S2.Figure 8shows the subgraph for the cell wall biosynthesis process forArabidopsisWS ecotype in spaceflight microgravity, which is also extracted similarly by thresholding the correlation values. These genes encode NSEs and have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight, as they were not found to be hubs in the GRNs for the terrestrial datasets. These enzymes catalyze a series of biochemical reactions and are involved in building cell wall polysaccharides. The origin and divergence of these enzymes is not known, and it is interesting to note that they are significantly transcribed indicative of higher sugar diversity in spaceflight microgravity. The higher regulations of these genes may be the reason for the phenotypic skewing or waving effect found in the roots, as well as other parts of the plant in spaceflight. The differential transcriptions of NSEs indicate that they regulate developmental, metabolic, and stress related responses in the spaceflight microgravity environment.\n\nRoot growth hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight microgravity and their most prominent gene ontology.\n\nGene regulatory sub graph involving root growth genes inArabidopsis thalianaCol 0 mutantphyDin spaceflight total light environment.

    "discussion": "The Pearson correlation method is used to generate weighted directed graphs. Two columns of 20,000 samples of gene expression values of Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col 0 root growth in spaceflight from GLDS 7 and GLDS 120 datasets are plotted in Figure 2 (A) and (B), respectively. X  axis is the first column of the gene expression values and y  axis is the second column of the gene expression values. The plot shows that the values are highly correlated. Hence, PCA is first applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data to three dimensions. The three PCA components are then used for computing Pearson correlation and generating the network, as explained in Section 2.2.2 . All the gene expression values from GLDS 7 and GLDS 120 spaceflight and ground data for Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth are used for generating the networks. In Table 1 , sample correlation values between 13 genes, their t statistics, and their p  values are given. Correlation values range from  1 to 1. P  values can also be used to construct GRNs by thresholding them between, for example, 0.01, and 0.0001, which will give the same network as a correlation threshold of 0.05. The threshold can be adjusted depending on the required level of complexity of the inferenced GRN. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show sub graphs extracted from GLDS 7 root growth spaceflight and ground gene expression data, respectively, with a correlation threshold of 0.05. This threshold selects 11.3% of genes from the GLDS 7 dataset and 28.7% genes from the GLDS 120 dataset. These are weighted and directed sub graphs extracted from the GLDS 7 spaceflight and ground GRNs, respectively. The weights are the correlation values (positive and negative) between the hub gene and the target gene, shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 . Negative interactions are important because they show an activation inhibition two way expression pattern. While positive correlations indicate shifting, scaling, or geometric pattern in gene expression data, negative correlations indicate opposite and complementary expression patterns, and self negative regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Hence, we have extracted both maximal positive and negative correlations for constructing the GRNs. These gene interactions have not been validated by follow up experiments; however, they have been constructed from gene expression data obtained originally from experiments conducted in the ISS.\n\nTable 1.

The GRN of Col 0 mutant phyD in spaceflight light environment has the lowest number of shared hub genes. The phyD gene has a role in Red/Far Red Light Sensing [ 48 ]. From our network analysis, we see that manipulation of a gene in an Arabidopsis ecotype can result in significantly different transcriptomic response that makes the biological organism to better adapt to the spaceflight environment [ 20 ].\n\nFigure 6 shows the Pearson correlation gene regulatory sub graphs extracted from GRNs of the GLDS 120 dataset for the catabolic process for the Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth in spaceflight light environment. The number of hub genes in the GRN representation can be controlled by suitably adjusting the threshold value. The lower the threshold, larger number of hub genes can be detected and vice versa. In all our networks, we have used a nominal correlation threshold value of 0.05. The original networks have more than 600 genes involved in regulatory pathways. The GSEA of these hub genes present in spaceflight microgravity and ground control GRNs for WS, Col 0, and Col mutant phyD ecotypes grown in different light environments are presented below.\n\n3.1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) The hub genes, shared genes for spaceflight and ground environments, and their gene ontology from the GeneLab GLDS 7 root growth datasets are given in Table 2 . The ShinyGO tool ( http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/ , accessed on 5 February 2021) is used to perform GSEA of the hub genes for the GeneLab GLDS 7 root growth GRN. The hub genes for spaceflight microgravity and ground overlap considerably and are involved in molecular functions, biological processes, and oxidation reduction process. They enable NADH dehydrogenase activity, and are involved in NAD and quinone binding. Contrary to GLDS 7 GRN functions, the GRNs constructed for the Arabidopsis WS, Col 0, and Col mutant phyD show significantly different regulations in spaceflight in total light. These GRNs do share genes with ground control GRNs, but have other genes that show significant transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity, and these genes are not shared by the ground GRNs. Hence, these genes can be considered to be affected by spaceflight microgravity alone. These genes are related to biological processes such as DNA integration, the RNA dependent DNA biosynthetic process, and the DNA metabolic process. We performed a GSEA analysis comparing hub genes for the WS wild ecotype and Col 0 ecotype. The hub genes for the WS ecotype are associated with biological processes such as the catabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, localization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The hub genes for the Col 0 ecotype perform similar functions to WS ecotype such as the catabolic process, regulation of metabolic process, positive regulation of biological process, cellular response to stimulus, signaling, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The shared hub genes between the Col 0 ecotype and Col 0 mutant phyD perform functions such as regulation of metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, positive regulation of biological process, anatomical structure development, and catabolic process. The non shared hub genes of phyD in spaceflight microgravity perform significant functions such as the cellular component organization of biogenesis, response to abiotic stress, and response to external stimulus.

GSEA for Common Hub Genes Eight common hub genes between the spaceflight and ground environments have been identified, as shown in Table 2 . Using g:Profiler, we found that these genes, including the gene ATMG00600 (ORF 106C), are uncharacterized mitochondrial protein and their function is DNA integration. AT1G04080 is a shared gene between the Col 0 and WS ecotypes, which encodes a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factor involved in alternative splicing. AT1G02930 and AT1G04980 are the shared genes between the Col 0 and Col 0 mutant phyD , which are involved in the defense response to bacterium, glutathione metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, response to oxidative stress, water deprivation, heat, response to unfolded protein, and ubiquitin pathway. The Pearson and LASSO methods have led to the identification of signature sub networks that show the interaction across several important metabolic and signaling processes, and Transcription Factors (TFs) for Arabidopsis growth in spaceflight microgravity. Both methods were able to identify the transcription factors AT1G06040, AT1G01720, and AT1G04850. AT1G06040 encodes salt tolerance protein and AT1G01720 is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and has a DNA binding TF activity. The TF AT1G04850 is a ubiquitin associated (UBA)/TS N domain containing protein, and its function is zinc ion binding. From the GRNs, we can identify genes with the maximum degree (hub genes) that regulate a larger number of authority (target) genes. 3.1.2. Gene Ontology of Transcription Factors (Genes) in Spaceflight Thirty eight hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight have been identified from the total light environment gene expression datasets of GLDS 120. Their ATG number, gene name, and gene ontology are presented in Supplementary Table S1 . These are hub genes, as their transcriptional responses are abundant only in spaceflight microgravity network and are not found to be hub genes in the corresponding terrestrial GRNs. Hence, these genes are functioning only in spaceflight microgravity conditions. From their ontology, it is evident that they are responsible for important functions necessary for the plant's growth in an altered environmental setup compared to the terrestrial environment. The plant can sense the changes in abiotic stressors such as gravity, oxygen, and radiation and can step up transcriptional regulation to adapt to the new environment successfully. The transcription functions of these genes are chiefly cell wall biosynthesis, protein transport, stress responses, catabolic processes, auxin, and protein regulation. It is also significant that these genes were identifiable only from the GLDS 120 dataset, which had a different lighting environment in spaceflight. Through novel graph theoretic methods applied to GRNs of Arabidopsis , we can explain phenomenological traits that have been observed in spaceflight vis  vis on the ground.\n\n3.2. Topological and Spectral Analyses of Gene Regulatory Networks Topological and algebraic analyses of the GRNs are given in Table 3 . The WS ecotype in total light spaceflight environment has the largest spectral gap, which indicates that this network has the highest performance with stable synchronization, rapid convergence, mixing, expansion, and diffusion [ 47 ]. Random walks propagate more easily in networks with a large spectral gap. The large spectral gap has also made several algorithms we use tractable for such massively large GRN and indicates that in technical terms, these GRNs are highly sparse. This corroborates with results from other studies that have shown that the WS genotype increases the transcriptional cost of spaceflight adaptation [ 20 ]. The diameter of this network is 6, indicating that it has longer gene signaling pathways, and the hub genes of this network regulate about 1000 target genes. The WS and Col 0 ecotypes in the ground light environment show topological similarities with the same shortest path length, and the two networks show regulation of about 45 target genes. Table 3.

Rather than just the degree distribution, hubs and authority nodes are computed iteratively with newer algorithms considering weights using its implementation in the software SAGEMATH. Improved algorithms exist, e.g., [ 35 ], and some of Kleinberg's works.\n\n3.3. Arabidopsis Root Growth and Cell Wall Biosynthesis in Spaceflight Microgravity Out of the 33 root growth related genes of Arabidopsis , we have identified five significant hub genes listed in Table 4 to have higher regulations in spaceflight. Figure 7 shows the subgraph that is extracted from the original Pearson correlation GRN by thresholding the genes with higher correlation values and involved in the cell wall biosynthesis metabolic process that relates the co expression of these genes in spaceflight microgravity for the Arabidopsis Col mutant phyD ecotype. These five hub genes have higher regulations only in the spaceflight subgraph for the cell wall response process and not in the ground subgraph. These genes are over represented in the spaceflight responsive transcriptome because they regulate plant growth in spaceflight microgravity and enable adaptation of the plant to the altered environment. Similarly, comparing the GRNs generated by the LASSO method for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight and ground environments, the hub genes that are involved only in spaceflight for cell wall biosynthesis have been identified and listed in Supplementary Table S2 . Figure 8 shows the subgraph for the cell wall biosynthesis process for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight microgravity, which is also extracted similarly by thresholding the correlation values. These genes encode NSEs and have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight, as they were not found to be hubs in the GRNs for the terrestrial datasets. These enzymes catalyze a series of biochemical reactions and are involved in building cell wall polysaccharides. The origin and divergence of these enzymes is not known, and it is interesting to note that they are significantly transcribed indicative of higher sugar diversity in spaceflight microgravity. The higher regulations of these genes may be the reason for the phenotypic skewing or waving effect found in the roots, as well as other parts of the plant in spaceflight. The differential transcriptions of NSEs indicate that they regulate developmental, metabolic, and stress related responses in the spaceflight microgravity environment. Table 4.

    "conclusion": "Graph based network analysis methods and results have been presented for transcriptomic regulatory GeneLabArabidopsisdatasets. Previous studies were at the transcriptomic level. In this article, we have built gene regulatory networks for different ecotypes (via Pearson Correlation and LASSO methods), carried out both topological and algebraic network studies (the novel HITS algorithm for weighted and directed graphs to identify hubs and authority nodes), computed the spectral gap for the whole GRN, leading us to potential conclusions about phenomena such as diffusion and expansion of the GRN, and studied global and local topological parameters, such as clustering, average path length, eccentricity, and degree distribution. Therefore, our research is more complementary to prior studies and is more rigorous. Our novel graph theoretic approach isolated hub genes regulated significantly different in spaceflight microgravity from terrestrial gene expressions. The GRN for the WS ecotype in spaceflight has the highest spectral gap, indicating that it has the highest transcriptional cost in spaceflight. GRN analysis showed that there are 38 genes with higher transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in vital molecular and biological functions for the survival and growth of the plant in spaceflight.\n\nWhile previous research has identified altered spaceflight transcriptions for cell wall remodeling, we have identified hub genes with higher transcriptional activity and that are involved in the cell wall response process only in spaceflight GRN; these hub genes are essentially metabolic phenotypes. The network analysis has detected xyloglucan endo trans glycosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) that are cell wall modifying enzymes mediating vital elongation growth ofArabidopsisin spaceflight. TheXTHsact on the cell wall, making it more extensible, resulting in cellular expansion and the skewing phenomenon of the roots in spaceflight microgravity.\n\nThrough advanced network analysis, we can shorten the gap between genotype to phenotype analysis by identifying primary metabolites or metabolic phenotypes involved in the growth of plants in spaceflight for bioregenerative life support. In the absence of mass spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging methods in the ISS, and lack of plant physiological measurements, genome to phenome network analysis offers an alternative for identifying primary metabolic phenotypes. The spaceflight response of these metabolites can be further correlated with phenotypic data extracted from images and metabolomics datasets acquired from experiments conducted in the ISS or from similar experiments on the ground. Phenotypic data will enable novel trait correlations employing genome to phenome network analysis."
