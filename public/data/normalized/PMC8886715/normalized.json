    "abstract": "The emergence of\ndouble mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has\ndropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS CoV 2 infection. Although\nCOVID 19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more\nthan 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the\nimmune system of the human body can control the SARS CoV 2 infection.\nHerein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil\nalpha defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL 37 peptide conjugated\ngraphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta\nvariant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS CoV 2 delta\nvariant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding\nwith host cells' angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental\ndata shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike\nprotein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant\nspike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly.\nExperimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern Volmer\nquenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the\nmodified Hill equation, we have determinedn= 2.6\nand the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with\nthe ACE2 spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike RBD, experimental data shows that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those\nfor the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T human\nACE2 cell line indicates that peptide conjugated GQDs have the capability\nfor completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions\ninto host cells via blocking the ACE2 spike protein binding.\nExperimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL 37 peptide \nand HNP1 peptide attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one\ntype of peptide attached GQDs.",
    "methods": "GQDs were developed in a two step process, as shown inScheme S1in the Supporting Information. Initially,\ngraphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite\npowder using the modified Hummer's method as we and others\nhave reported before.18 23In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method\nin the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF).18 23The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported inFigure S2Ain the Supporting Information shows\nthe two dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with\n5 +/  2 um size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported\ninFigure S2Bshows the zero dimensional\n(0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 +/ \n2 nm.Table S1shows the dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM\ndata. As shown inFigure1A, for the development of HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense\npeptide attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between\nthe carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides.\n\nThe FTIR data from peptide attached GQDs, as reported inFigure S2G, shows the presence of the  OH\nstretch,  CH stretch,  amide I,  amide II, and\n amide III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached\non the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the  potential\nchanges from  14 +/  2 mV to 3 +/  1 mV after peptide\nbinding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface\nof GQDs. The TEM data reported inFigure2A indicates that the size of peptide conjugated\nGQDs are 6 +/  2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data\nreported inTable S1. The inset inFigure2A shows the high resolution\nTEM for peptide conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure\nwith a stripe distance of 0.24 nm.18 23Similarly,Figure S2Cin the Supporting\nInformation shows the powder X ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which\nindicates a broad peak at 26.5 degrees due to the (002) reflection of\ngraphite.18 23Figure S2Dshows the Raman spectra of\npeptide attached GQDs, which indicate the presence of the D band at\n1350 cm 1and the G band at 1590\ncm 1due to the graphene structure.18 23\n\n(A)\nTEM image of freshly prepared peptide conjugated GQDs.

(H) Plot showing\nthe binding curve between the peptide conjugated GQDs and SARS CoV 2\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein in the ELISA plate based assay.\n\nFor the binding between the SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein RBD and HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense peptide attached\nGQDs, we used a binding buffer. The experimental details are reported\nin theSupporting Information. For the\ndetection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense peptide attached\nGQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS CoV 2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer\ndeveloped by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.13,14,21,22For emission signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer\nfrom Ocean Optics.13,14,21,22All measurements were performed with 5 ms\nintegration time with five spectra averaging using the software.13,14,21,22\n\nFor this purpose, we used an ELISA like assay using\nHis tag delta variant SARS CoV 2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed\nto a 96 well plate overnight at 4  degreesC. For comparison with fluorescence\nassay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins\nthe same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked\nusing a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide attached\nGQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin\nprotein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP) enzyme to determine the binding.11 15We also used TMB (3,3,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine)\nfor colorimetric assay detection.11 15Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader.\nAfter that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding\ncurve, we estimated the binding constants (KD) using the Hill equation, as reported before.7,8,11,12\n\nFor this experiment,\nwe used human embryonic kidney 239T cells with a high expression of\nACE2 (HEK 293T).11 15,26,27Since delta variant SARS CoV 2 is a biosafety level 3 virus, for\nour experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein) tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein\n(catalog number #C1123G).11 15,26,27The experimental details are reported in theSupporting Information.\n\nFor this experiment,\nwe used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL 37 human host\ndefense peptide attached GQDs were made in DMEM.13,14,26,27The GFP tagged\nBaculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense\npeptide attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for\n1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.",
    "results": "The UV vis spectra from HNP1 and LL 37 human\nhost defense peptide attached GQDs, as reported inFigure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed\nat 270 nm, which can be due to the  *\ntransition, and the second peak is at 306 nm, which can be\ndue to the n * transition.18 23Figure S2FandFigure2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide attached\nGQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416\nnm can be due to the electron hole recombination and quantum\nsize effect.18 23Figure2B shows that\npeptide attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV\nlight. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to\nbe 0.28 for peptide attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay\nprofiles for peptide attached GQDs are reported inFigure2D, which fit very well with\nthe triple exponential function with 1= 0.32 ns,\n2= 2.2 ns, and 3= 7.3 ns.\n\nTo determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL 37\nand HNP1 peptide attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung\ncancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney 239T cells with a high\nexpression of ACE2 (HEK 293T).11 15,26,27All cells were treated with 60 ug/mL GQDs + 4 ug/mL\nLL 37 + 4 ug/mL HNP1 for 48 h.11 15,26,27As reported inFigures S3A,Bin the Supporting\nInformation, after treatment with LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly\nchanged for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly\nindicate that the LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs do not exhibit\nany detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.\n\nNext, we have\ndetermined whether the SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense peptide attached\nGQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus\ninfection. The experimental details are reported in theSupporting Information. The luminescence signals\nfrom GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded\nwith a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.11 15,26,27The reported photograph inFigure2B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide conjugated\nGQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein.\n\nIn the\ncase of peptide attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind\nwith the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,\nand charge transfer interaction.18,19On the other\nhand, LL 37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via\nhydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.11,12,15The observed huge fluorescence\nquenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide attached\nGQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can\nbe the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent\ncomplex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching\ncan be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Frster\nresonance energy transfer from the donor peptide attached GQDs to\nthe acceptor spike protein. As reported inFigure2D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains\nalmost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (1= 0.30 ns, 2= 2.2 ns, and 3= 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar\nto the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime\ndata clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching\nprocess.\n\nSimilarly, as reported inFigure S1Ein the Supporting Information, the UV vis absorption\nmaximum\nfrom peptide attached GQDs is 10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength\nin the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation\nof a complex in the ground state between the peptide attached GQDs\nand spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described\nby the Stern Volmer equation20,22,24,25as described below\n\nwhereF0is the fluorescence intensity\nfrom the peptide conjugated\nGQDs in the absence of the spike protein,Fis the\nfluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]\nis the protein concentration.KSVis the\nStern Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients\n(Kq) and the lifetime 0of the GQDs' excited state in the absence of spike. As shown\ninFigure2E, the plot\nof log[F0/F] versus log[spike\nconcentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL 37 peptide conjugated GQDs indicates\nthe nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to\nthe multiple binding sites.\n\nSince we have observed a nonlinear\nStern Volmer quenching\nprofile, we have used the modified Hill equation24,25\n\nwhereKbis the dissociation constant, [S]tis the concentration of the spike protein\nat any\ngiven time, [G]tis the\nconcentration of peptide conjugated GQDs at any given time, andnis the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding\naffinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting\nthe curve witheq3,\nas reported inFigures2E,G. As shown inTable1, we have determined the binding affinity as 8 +/  1 nM andn= 2.6.\n\nAs shown inFigures2F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense\npeptide attached\nGQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases.\nBy fitting the curve usingeq3, we have determined the binding affinity as 120 +/  20\nnM in this case, as reported inTable1.\n\nTo verify our data with a well documented assay,\nwe used the ELISA like\nassay using the His tag delta variant SARS CoV 2 S1 protein.26,27The experimental details are reported in theSupporting Information. As reported inFigure2H, the plot shows the binding curve between\nthe peptide conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate based\nassay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity\nas 9 +/  1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL 37 and HNP1 peptide conjugated\nGQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data.\nSimilarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant\nspike with different peptide conjugated GQDs, LL 37 and HNP1 peptides\nand ACE2, as reported inTable1.\n\nFrom the experimental data, we can conclude that the\nbinding affinities\nfor the delta variant spike with LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs are comparable with that for ACE2 delta variant spike binding.\nAlso, the binding affinities for LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs are better than only one type of peptide attached GQDs. The observed\nhigher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides\n(HNP and LL 37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide\ncan be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike\nprotein in the case of two peptide attached GQDs. The reported theoretical\nmodeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike RBD in eight sites\n(LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).7,11On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike RBD in six sites (LYS417,\nALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493).7,11The\nobserved higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction.\n\nDuring the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages\nsuch as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2),\nand omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen.1 6To understand how the binding affinity between LL 37 & HNP1 attached\nGQDs and the SARS CoV 2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies,\nwe have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability\nwith peptide attached GQDs. As reported inTable2, our experimental data indicate that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike RBD is higher\nthan those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike RBD.\n\nNext, to find out whether LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs can bind with delta variant SARS CoV 2, we have performed an\nexperiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown inFigure3A, the luminescence intensity from peptide attached\nGQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates\nthat LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus\npseudotyped SARS CoV 2.\n\n(A) Fluorescence spectra from HNP1 and LL 37\npeptide conjugated\nGQDs in the presence and absence of GFP tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped\nwith a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein.

(E) Bright field\nimage of HEK 293T cells in the presence of GFP tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped without GQDs.

(G) Fluorescence image of HEK 293T cells in\nthe presence of GFP tagged virus bound with LL 37 & HNP1 human\nhost defense peptide attached GQDs. (H) Bright field image of HEK 293T\ncells in the presence of GFP tagged virus bound with LL 37 & HNP1\nhuman host defense peptide attached GQDs.\n\nAs reported inFigure3B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide conjugated GQDs\nare bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL 37 peptide \nand HNP1 peptide attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1 attached\nGQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the\nvirus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine\nwhether HNP1 and LL 37 peptide conjugated GQDs have the capability\nto prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking\nthe spike protein RBD ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic\nkidney 239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK 293T). For this\nexperiment, we have used GFP tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a\nSARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number\n#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in theSupporting Information.26,27As shown inFigure3D, in the absence of peptide attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta\nvariant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK 293T cells. The observed green\nfluorescence is due to the presence of GFP tagged pseudotyped virus\nparticles on the surface of HEK 293T cells via binding with ACE2.Figure3E shows the bright field\nimage of HEK 293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped\nvirus on the cell surface. As shown inFigure3H, in the presence of LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on\nHEK 293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence.\n\nSince LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs have high binding affinity\nwith the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates\nthat they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2\nand the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported inFigures3F,G, LL 37 peptide attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein ACE2 binding. As reported\ninFigure4B, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported inTable1.\n\n(A) Interaction of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta\nvariant (B.1.617.2) spike protein and ACE2 on HEK 293T cells, measured\nusing fluorescence imaging. (B) Inhibition efficiency of Baculovirus\npseudotyped with the delta variant spike protein in infected HEK293T\ncells in the presence of buffer (Mock), GQDs (30 ug/mL), HNP1\n(4 ug/mL) attached GQDs (30 ug/mL), LL 37 (4 ug/mL) attached\nGQDs (30 ug/mL), and LL 37 (4 ug/mL) and HNP1 (4 ug/mL) attached\nGQDs (30 ug/mL).

(D) TEM image of Baculovirus\npseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein\nwhen they are treated with peptide attached GQDs for 12 h.\n\nNext, we have estimated the\ninhibition ability for delta variant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions using\npeptide conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in\ntheSupporting Information.13,14,26,27Figure4B shows the\n% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved\nin the case of LL 37 (4 ug/mL) and HNP1 (4 ug/mL) attached\nGQDs (30 ug/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 ug/mL) were used.\n\nThe\nreported data inTable3andFigure4B also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL 37 (4 ug/mL)\npeptide attached GQDs (30 ug/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL 37 (4 ug/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL 37 and HNP1 attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL 37 and HNP1 attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image inFigure4C and the TEM image\ninFigure4D clearly\nshow that LL 37 and HNP1 attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses\nand spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.\nThe above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.",
    "discussion": "3.1. Determining\nthe Photoluminescence Quantum\nYield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL 37 Human Host Defense Peptide Attached\nGQDs The UV vis spectra from HNP1 and LL 37 human\nhost defense peptide attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E , show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed\nat 270 nm, which can be due to the  *\ntransition, and the second peak is at 306 nm, which can be\ndue to the n * transition. 18   23 Figure S2F and Figure 2 C show the luminescence spectra of peptide attached\nGQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416\nnm can be due to the electron hole recombination and quantum\nsize effect. 18   23 Figure 2 B shows that\npeptide attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV\nlight. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to\nbe 0.28 for peptide attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay\nprofiles for peptide attached GQDs are reported in Figure 2 D, which fit very well with\nthe triple exponential function with  1 = 0.32 ns,\n 2 = 2.2 ns, and  3 = 7.3 ns.\n\n3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL 37\nand HNP1 peptide attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung\ncancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney 239T cells with a high\nexpression of ACE2 (HEK 293T). 11   15 , 26 , 27 All cells were treated with 60 ug/mL GQDs + 4 ug/mL\nLL 37 + 4 ug/mL HNP1 for 48 h. 11   15 , 26 , 27 As reported in Figures S3A,B in the Supporting\nInformation, after treatment with LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly\nchanged for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly\nindicate that the LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs do not exhibit\nany detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.\n\n3.3. Determining the Binding Affinity between the\nSARS CoV 2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and\nLL 37 Human Host Defense Peptide Attached GQDs Next, we have\ndetermined whether the SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL 37 human host defense peptide attached\nGQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus\ninfection. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information . The luminescence signals\nfrom GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded\nwith a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser. 11   15 , 26 , 27 The reported photograph in Figure 2 B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide conjugated\nGQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the\ncase of peptide attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind\nwith the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,\nand charge transfer interaction. 18 , 19 On the other\nhand, LL 37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via\nhydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction. 11 , 12 , 15 The observed huge fluorescence\nquenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide attached\nGQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can\nbe the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent\ncomplex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching\ncan be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Frster\nresonance energy transfer from the donor peptide attached GQDs to\nthe acceptor spike protein. As reported in Figure 2 D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains\nalmost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime ( 1 = 0.30 ns,  2 = 2.2 ns, and  3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar\nto the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime\ndata clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching\nprocess. Similarly, as reported in Figure S1E in the Supporting Information, the UV vis absorption\nmaximum\nfrom peptide attached GQDs is 10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength\nin the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation\nof a complex in the ground state between the peptide attached GQDs\nand spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described\nby the Stern Volmer equation 20 , 22 , 24 , 25 as described below 1 2 where F 0 is the fluorescence intensity\nfrom the peptide conjugated\nGQDs in the absence of the spike protein, F is the\nfluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]\nis the protein concentration. K SV is the\nStern Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients\n( K q ) and the lifetime  0 of the GQDs' excited state in the absence of spike. As shown\nin Figure 2 E, the plot\nof log[ F 0 / F ] versus log[spike\nconcentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL 37 peptide conjugated GQDs indicates\nthe nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to\nthe multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear\nStern Volmer quenching\nprofile, we have used the modified Hill equation 24 , 25 3 where K b is the dissociation constant, [ S ] t is the concentration of the spike protein\nat any\ngiven time, [ G ] t is the\nconcentration of peptide conjugated GQDs at any given time, and n is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding\naffinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting\nthe curve with eq 3 ,\nas reported in Figures 2 E,G. As shown in Table 1 , we have determined the binding affinity as 8 +/  1 nM and n = 2.6. Table 1.

To verify our data with a well documented assay,\nwe used the ELISA like\nassay using the His tag delta variant SARS CoV 2 S1 protein. 26 , 27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information . As reported in Figure 2 H, the plot shows the binding curve between\nthe peptide conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate based\nassay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity\nas 9 +/  1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL 37 and HNP1 peptide conjugated\nGQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data.\nSimilarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant\nspike with different peptide conjugated GQDs, LL 37 and HNP1 peptides\nand ACE2, as reported in Table 1 . From the experimental data, we can conclude that the\nbinding affinities\nfor the delta variant spike with LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs are comparable with that for ACE2 delta variant spike binding.\nAlso, the binding affinities for LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs are better than only one type of peptide attached GQDs. The observed\nhigher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides\n(HNP and LL 37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide\ncan be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike\nprotein in the case of two peptide attached GQDs. The reported theoretical\nmodeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike RBD in eight sites\n(LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502). 7 , 11 On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike RBD in six sites (LYS417,\nALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493). 7 , 11 The\nobserved higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages\nsuch as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2),\nand omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen. 1   6 To understand how the binding affinity between LL 37 & HNP1 attached\nGQDs and the SARS CoV 2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies,\nwe have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability\nwith peptide attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2 , our experimental data indicate that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike RBD is higher\nthan those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike RBD.

Demonstrating ACE2 Spike\nProtein Binding\nBlocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS CoV 2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)\nVirus Next, to find out whether LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs can bind with delta variant SARS CoV 2, we have performed an\nexperiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in Figure 3 A, the luminescence intensity from peptide attached\nGQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates\nthat LL 37 peptide  and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus\npseudotyped SARS CoV 2. Figure 3.

(H) Bright field image of HEK 293T\ncells in the presence of GFP tagged virus bound with LL 37 & HNP1\nhuman host defense peptide attached GQDs. As reported in Figure 3 B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide conjugated GQDs\nare bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL 37 peptide \nand HNP1 peptide attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1 attached\nGQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the\nvirus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine\nwhether HNP1 and LL 37 peptide conjugated GQDs have the capability\nto prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking\nthe spike protein RBD ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic\nkidney 239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK 293T). For this\nexperiment, we have used GFP tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a\nSARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number\n#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information . 26 , 27 As shown in Figure 3 D, in the absence of peptide attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta\nvariant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK 293T cells. The observed green\nfluorescence is due to the presence of GFP tagged pseudotyped virus\nparticles on the surface of HEK 293T cells via binding with ACE2. Figure 3 E shows the bright field\nimage of HEK 293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped\nvirus on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3 H, in the presence of LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on\nHEK 293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs have high binding affinity\nwith the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates\nthat they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2\nand the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL 37 and HNP1 peptide attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported in Figures 3 F,G, LL 37 peptide attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein ACE2 binding. As reported\nin Figure 4 B, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported in Table 1 .

Determining the Inhibition Ability for LL 37\nand HNP1 Peptide Conjugated GQDs Using the B Pseudotyped SARS CoV 2\nDelta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, we have estimated the\ninhibition ability for delta variant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions using\npeptide conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in\nthe Supporting Information . 13 , 14 , 26 , 27 Figure 4 B shows the\n% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved\nin the case of LL 37 (4 ug/mL) and HNP1 (4 ug/mL) attached\nGQDs (30 ug/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 ug/mL) were used. The\nreported data in Table 3 and Figure 4 B also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL 37 (4 ug/mL)\npeptide attached GQDs (30 ug/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL 37 (4 ug/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL 37 and HNP1 attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL 37 and HNP1 attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in Figure 4 C and the TEM image\nin Figure 4 D clearly\nshow that LL 37 and HNP1 attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS CoV 2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses\nand spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.\nThe above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

    "conclusion": "In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL 37\npeptide conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus\nentry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with\nACE2. We have demonstrated that peptide attached GQD based fluorescence\nquenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental\ndata show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and\nLL 37 peptide conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable\nwith the ACE2 spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike RBD, we have shown that the binding\naffinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for\nother variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T human\nACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL 37 and HNP1 peptide conjugated\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS CoV 2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition\nefficiency for two peptide attached GQDs is much higher than those\nfor only one type of peptide attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs."
