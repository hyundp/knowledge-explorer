    "abstract": "Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele ofArabidopsis thaliana SCD1(stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of thescd1 1mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25 degreesC, but not at the permissive temperature of 18 degreesC. Inscd1 1at 25 degreesC, PIN1  and PIN2 GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25 degreesC for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2 GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2 GFP inscd1 1exhibited FM4 64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.\n\nKeywords:SCD1, gravitropism, lateral root, auxin transport, PIN2,Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "methods": "Seeds were sterilized (75% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X 100) for 2 min, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse. The culture medium was 0.8% (w/v) agar (MP Biomedical), 1X MS nutrients (macro and micro salts: MSP01 50LT, Caisson Labs, Inc.), vitamins (1 ug/mL 1thiamine, 1 ug/mL 1pyridoxine HCL, and 0.5 ug/mL 1nicotinic acid), 1.5% sucrose (w/v), and 0.05% MES (w/v); pH adjusted to 6.0 with 1M KOH. The seeds were placed in the dark at 4 degreesC for 48 h before being moved to the permissive (18 degreesC) or the restrictive (25 degreesC) temperatures. The seedlings were grown vertically under continuous light at an intensity of 100 umol m 2s 1for 5 or 7 days at the specified temperature.\n\nThe Arabidopsisscd1 1mutant (Falbel et al., 2003) was crossed with a number of fluorescent protein fusions all driven by their endogenous promoters: PIN2 GFP (Xu and Scheres, 2005), PIN1 GFP (Heisler et al., 2005), PIN3 GFP (Laskowski et al., 2008), MDR1(ABCB19) GFP (Wu et al., 2007), AUX1 YFP (Swarup et al., 2008), and the auxin responsive promoter driven GFP reporter, DR5 GFP (Ottenschlger et al., 2003;Lewis et al., 2011). The F2 generation was screened for lines homozygous for mutant phenotype and for reporter GFP expression.scd1 1containing PIN2 GFP was also crossed with reporters that localize to specific endomembrane compartments, with these organelle specific reporters listed inSupplementary Table S1.\n\nSeedlings of similar size were placed on fresh agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25 degreesC. Lateral roots initiation events corresponding to stages VI and VII of primordia (Malamy and Benfey, 1997) and emerged lateral roots (defined as any root that broke through the epidermis of the primary root) were quantified using a dissecting microscope.\n\nTo examine lateral root formation in seedlings that were moved between temperature conditions, Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings were grown at 18 or 25 degreesC continuously or transferred from 18 to 25 degreesC at 2, 4, or 6 days. Parallel experiments were performed where seedlings were grown at 25 degreesC continuously or transferred from 25 to 18 degreesC at the indicated times. The number of lateral root initiation events and the number of emerged lateral roots were quantified by DIC microscopy using the Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a Plan Apochromatic 40x objective and the reported data is from 20 seedlings.\n\nPulse chase rootward (acropetal) IAA transport assays were performed using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009) in Col(g) seedlings at 9 and 6 days at 18 and 25 degrees C, respectively.scd1 1seedlings were assayed at 10 days for both 18 degreesC and 25 degreesC to more closely match the length ofscd1 1and Col(g). An agar droplet (1.25% agar w/v) containing 1 uM tritiated IAA was placed at the root shoot junction and incubated at 18 or 25 degreesC for 10 min. The seedlings were transferred to a new agar plate and exposed to a \"chase\" droplet of unlabeled 1 uM IAA. After 50 min, 2 mm sections were excised beginning at the base of the droplet toward the root tip. Three to six segments were recovered from all plants, and each segment was counted separately, and IAA levels quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The average and SE of 19 25 seedlings is reported in all transport assays.\n\nShootward IAA transport was measured by applying 500 nM tritiated IAA (3H IAA) to root tips (Lewis and Muday, 2009) of 5 day seedlings grown at 18 or 25 degreesC. For temperature switch experiments, seedlings were transferred to the appropriate temperature 4, 8, and 24 h before assay. Agar droplets containing 500 nM3H IAA were applied to the root tips, and seedlings were placed into the indicated temperatures under yellow filters to prevent auxin degradation (Stasinopoulos and Hangarter, 1990). After 2 h, the droplets were removed from the root tip. A 5 mm segment was excised 2 mm from the site of3H IAA application, and radioactivity was measured.\n\nShootward IAA transport was also measured indirectly using the artificial DR5 promoter driving expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Ottenschlger et al., 2003). Droplets containing 1 uM unlabeled IAA in 1.25% agar were applied to the root tips of 5 day old seedlings grown at 18 or 25 degreesC for the designated times. GFP fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss 710 LSCM (Jena, Germany) using the argon laser with excitation at 488 nm. Images of root tips were captured using 80% laser power with 40x magnification, a pinhole of 2.64 airy units (AU), 560 gain and an emission spectrum of 493 656 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop, and the distance of GFP fluorescence in the epidermal layers was measured using the line tool.\n\nFive day old Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC were placed in diffuse light at 20 22 umol m 2s 1and re oriented 90 degrees. Images were captured for low temporal resolution analysis at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re orientation, with a final image 24 h after re orientation. Images were captured using an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo Perfection flatbed scanner (Nagano, Japan) with 16 bit grayscale and 800 dpi resolution. Images were exported to ImageJ to measure degree of curvature.\n\nThe gravitropic root response was also observed using high temporal resolution imaging using an AVT Marlin camera (Stadtroda, Germany). Root curvature after gravity stimulation was measured by a MATLAB based custom image analysis software (Lewis et al., 2007) and is the average and standard error of 12 seedlings of each genotype.\n\nCol(g) andscd1 1seedlings crossed with the proDR5 GFP construct were imaged after roots were reoriented 90 degrees relative to the gravity vector. Seedlings were placed on agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25 degreesC. After 1 h, seedlings were placed in diffuse light at 20 22 umol m 2s 1and reoriented 90 degrees. Images were captured at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re orientation. Seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to visualize root structure and mounted in dH20 on slides. The root tips were visualized with the 40x objective of a Zeiss 710 LSCM using the argon laser at an excitation wavelength of 488nm and a pinhole of 1.0 AU. GFP emission was collected between 492 and 547 nm, while PI was collected at 567 735. All images were collected at identical gain and laser power and exported to Adobe Photoshop for analysis. Representative images of more than 5 roots at each time point and from each genotype were shown.\n\nCol(g) andscd1 1seedlings containing PIN2 GFP, PIN1 GFP, PIN3 GFP, ABCB19 GFP, and AUX1 YFP (protein fusions driven by endogenous promoters) were grown for 7 days at a constant 18 or 25 degreesC. Seedlings were mounted in dH2O and maintained at the indicated temperatures using a Julabo F25 temperature stage (Seelbach, Germany). Images were captured using a 63x water objective with or without a 1.5x optical zoom on a Zeiss 710 LSCM, using the argon laser for excitation at 488 nm with a pinhole of 1.0AU. PIN2 GFP, PIN1 GFP, PIN3 GFP, and MDR1 GFP were imaged with an emission spectrum of 500 525 nm, while AUX1 YFP was imaged with an emission spectrum of 519 621 nm.\n\nFor temperature shift experiments, wild type andscd1 1were grown at 18 degreesC for 7 days. Seedlings were transferred to microscope slides and then placed on the temperature controlled stage at 25 degreesC. Samples were imaged as described above at various times after transfer. For each reporter construct more than 5 roots were analyzed at each treatment, with representative images shown.\n\nSeedlings grown at 25 degreesC were incubated in 5 uM FM4 64 to visualize endosomes (Bolte et al., 2004) for either 5 or 20 min, as indicated. The roots were rinsed in dH2O and imaged at various times after staining. The GFP and FM4 64 signals were visualized using a multi track setting, as described above. No FM4 64 fluorescence was detected in the GFP channel. The FM4 64 signal was imaged using 80% laser power, a pinhole of 1.0 AU, 510 gain, and an emission spectrum of 632 759 nm. No GFP signal was detected in the FM4 64 channel. Individual images for each fluorophore and an overlay are shown with magenta for FM4 64, green for PIN2 GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4 64 and PIN2. The red signal in these images was converted to magenta in Photoshop, changing the hue saturation. To better identify spatial colocalization independent of intensity, a thresholding function was applied to individual channels in Photoshop or in the Zeiss Zen colocalization module. We then prepared a thresholded overlay in which pixels are indicated as magenta for FM4 64, green for PIN2 GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4 64 and GFP. To examine the change in colocalization of PIN2 GFP and FM4 64 over time, the number of PIN2 GFP, FM4 64, or both, signals in each cell with a PIN2 GFP labeled endomembrane compartment was quantified, and the percentage was determined for 740 cells from 20 roots. In the temperature shift experiments,scd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC for 7 days were transferred to 5 mM FM4 64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged at intervals of 2 min on a temperature controlled stage at 25 degreesC.\n\nCol(g) andscd1 1seedlings containing PIN2 GFP were crossed with fluorescently labeled endomembrane marker lines. These constructs and their localization patterns are summarized inSupplementary Table S1. The seedlings were grown for 7 days at 25 degreesC. Seedling roots were visualized using the Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope. GFP and RFP signals were resolved in dual channel mode with excitation at 488 and 594 nm, and emission wavelengths of 493 582 and 599 754 nm, respectively. For all samples, we verified the absence of RFP signal in the GFP channel and vice versa, using single labeled samples. For colocalization analysis, samples were examined using Zeiss Zen software. The threshold for RFP or GFP was determined within each image, using regions that had only signal from one fluorophore. We selected regions of interest (ROI) of consistent size, focusing on individual endomembrane compartments (French et al., 2008) from at least 4 roots each of Ara6 and Ara7 reporters, measuring 21 and 17 endomembranes, respectively. Colocalization was quantified using both Pearson's coefficients (weighted colocalization coefficients) and Manders' overlap coefficients (Manders et al., 1993;Dunn et al., 2011).\n\nLines containing both PIN2 GFP and other RFP reporters were examined in dual channel mode as described above. PIN2 GFP SYP61 CFP transgenics were imaged using spectral imaging and linear unmixing at an excitation wavelength of 458 nm and a 464 648 nm filter.",
    "results": "Ifscd1 1has a defect in targeting of auxin transport proteins, then alterations in auxin transport dependent root responses, including primary root elongation, gravitropism, and lateral root development, would be expected. Root growth and development ofscd1 1were compared to its parental line, Columbiaglabrous 1[(Col(g)], at 18 degreesC and at 25 degreesC. At 18 degreesC, Col(g) andscd1 1had similar primary root elongation rates and lateral root numbers (Figure 1). At 25 degreesCscd1 1primary roots were substantially shorter than Col(g) (Figure 1B), and the number of lateral roots were dramatically reduced (Figures 1B,C). We performed a two way ANOVA to determine which of these differences were statistically significant across this time course. In both root elongation and lateral root development,scd1 1was significantly impaired relative to Col(g) at both temperatures withp< 0.01 for all comparisons.\n\nRoot growth and lateral root formation inscd1 1are reduced at the restrictive temperature.(A)Col(g) andscd1 1roots 12 days after sowing grown under continuous light at 18 degreesC or 25 degreesC.(B,C)Primary root length(B)and lateral root number(C)were measured daily for Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings maintained at 25 or 18 degreesC. The average and SE (n= 20) are reported, although some errors are smaller than the symbols.(D,E)For these experiments, the total number of lateral roots was determined at 10 days after germination, but seedlings were grown at the indicated temperatures prior to this quantification with the average and standard error reported for 20 seedlings.(D)Seedlings were grown continuously at 25 degreesC, or at 18 degreesC for the indicated number of days before transfer to 25 degreesC, or continuously at 18 degreesC, as indicated in the left hand panel. In the right hand panel, the number of lateral root primordia are reported. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation.(E)The parallel experiment was performed where seedlings were grown continuously at either 18 degreesC, or at 18 degreesC and transferred to 25 degreesC on the indicated day, or continuously at 25 degreesC. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation.aIndicates significant differences in genotype between 18 degreesC control and indicated treatment determined by Student'sT test withp< 0.05.bIndicates significant differences in genotype between 25 degreesC control and indicated treatment as determined by Student'sT test withp< 0.05.\n\nThe temperature sensitive phenotype of thescd1 1mutant allowed us to ask if shorter term growth at 25 degreesC could induce this lateral root phenotype and whether the impaired root development at this restrictive temperature could be rescued by transition back to the permissive temperature. Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings were grown at constant 18 degreesC, or constant 25 degreesC, or grown at 18 degreesC and then transferred to 25 degreesC after 2, 4, or 6 days (Figures 1D,E). For all these treatments, the number of lateral roots was quantified on the 10th day after sowing, there was a significant difference in the number of lateral root initiation events between 18 and 25 degreesC for both Col(g) andscd1 1. Growth at 25 degreesC increased lateral root formation in Col(g) and decreased lateral root formation inscd1 1. Whenscd1 1seedlings were grown at 18 degreesC for 2 days before transfer to 25 degreesC, significantly fewer lateral roots formed than in plants grown continuously at 18 degreesC, while roots grown at 18 degreesC for 4 or 6 days before transfer to 25 degreesC formed an equivalent number of lateral roots to the continuous 18 degreesCscd1 1control (red box,Figure 1D), consistent with SCD1 function at 18 degreesC allowing lateral root development.\n\nIn a parallel experiment, Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings were grown at 25 degreesC and transferred to 18 degreesC after 2, 4, and 6 days (Figure 1E) to determine if the ability to form roots could be restored upon transition to the permissive temperature. There were significantly more lateral root primordia formed onscd1 1seedlings switched from 25 to 18 degreesC at days 2 and 4 than seedlings grown at a constant 25 degreesC or transitioned after 6 days. These two experiments indicate that there is a developmental window between 2 and 6 days in which SCD1 function is required for lateral root formation.\n\nWe examined the gravity response in wild type andscd1 1seedling roots. Wild type andscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 or 25 degreesC for 5 days were rotated 90 degrees (Figure 2). At 18 degreesC,scd1 1and wild type had identical gravitropic responses. However, at 25 degreesC, Col(g) showed a more rapid response than at 18 degreesC, with root curvature reaching 80 degrees and 50 degrees by 8 h at 25 degrees and 18 degreesC, respectively. In contrast,scd1 1at 25 degreesC showed a 50% reduction in the gravitropic response relative to Col(g), with root curvature reaching a mean angle of only 40 degrees.\n\nGravitropic response ofscd1 1at 25 degreesC is impaired relative to wildtype.(A,C)Five day wildtype andscd1 1seedlings were grown at(A)18 degreesC or(C)25 degreesC then rotated 90 degrees relative to the gravity vector, with images taken at up to 8 h after reorientation. The root tips of seedlings at 8 h after reorientation are overlaid on the image of the root before curvature and the arrow shows the position of the root tip at the time of reorientation.(B,D)Root curvature as a function of time after reorientation was quantified after reorientation for(B)roots grown at 18 degreesC and(D)roots grown at 25 degreesC. Error bars = +/  SEM.(E)The gravitropic curvature ofscd1 1and Col(g) plants grown for 5 days at 18 degreesC then transferred to 25 degreesC for 12 h prior to reorientation.(F)The gravitropic response ofscd1 1was quantified in seedlings grown at 18 degreesC and transferred to 25 degreesC for 4 h or 8 h before being reoriented 90 degrees relative to the gravity vector. Curvature was measured 8 h after reorientation.aDenotes a significant difference in gravitropic curvature betweenscd1 1at the indicated treatment andscd1 1at 18 degreesC andbdenotes a significant difference between treatment and Col(g) at 18 degreesC. For all panelsn= 12 seedlings of each genotype.\n\nTo eliminate developmental consequences of thescd1 1phenotype at the restrictive temperature on gravity response, we asked whether the gravity response would be impaired in plants grown at 18 degreesC for 5 days and transferred to 25 degreesC for 4 12 h prior to reorientation. The gravitropic response in thescd1 1mutant 12 h after transition to 25 degreesC was slower than Col(g), impaired to levels equivalent to seedlings grown continuously at 25 degreesC (Figure 2E). In contrast,scd1 1seedlings transferred from 18 to 25 degreesC for 4 h before reorientation did not show a decrease in gravitropic curvature as compared to Col(g), while 8 h at 25 degreesC led to a significant, but not complete, inhibition of curvature (Figure 2F). The elongation of roots of Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC and then transferred to 25 degreesC were also monitored (Supplementary Figure S1). A significant decrease in the growth rate ofscd1 1was observed beginning at 5 h after transfer to 25 degreesC, consistent with the impaired symmetric and asymmetric elongation ofscd1 1roots at 25 degreesC, but not 18 degreesC.\n\nIt is possible that the gravity defect observed inscd1 1was due to a change in physical structure of the gravity perception machinery, either the columella cells or their statoliths. When roots were grown at 18 degreesC or switched from 18 to 25 degreesC for 24 h, Col(g) andscd1 1had similar numbers of statoliths per cell and number of columella cells, suggesting that the gravitropic defect inscd1 1was not due to altered perception of the gravity vector (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\nRootward IAA transport, which is required for lateral root emergence (Reed et al., 1998;Bhalerao et al., 2002) was measured using an IAA pulse chase assay. At 18 degreesC, rootward transport was equivalent in Col(g) andscd1 1(Figure 3A). At 25 degreesC, the length of the zone of transported IAA was reduced (Figure 3B) and a significant reduction in the total rootward IAA transport (the sum of samples inFigures 3A,B) was evident inscd1 1relative to wild type (Figure 3C). When rootward IAA transport in Col(g) andscd1 1grown at constant 18 or 25 degreesC was compared to transport in plants grown at 18 degreesC and transferred to 25 degreesC for 6 h, reduced IAA transport was evident inscd1 1plants grown at constant 25 degreesC or at 18 degreesC and transferred to 25 degreesC for 6 h (Figure 3D).\n\nThescd1 1mutant has reduced IAA transport at the restrictive temperature. Rootward3H IAA transport was measured in a pulse chase assay using seedlings grown for 9 and 10 days for Col(g) andscd1 1, respectively, to match seedling length. Transported auxin was quantified in progressive 2 mm segments downstream of the site of application. For all panels, the averages and SE of 19 25 seedlings are reported.(A)Seedlings were grown at 18 degreesC.(B)Seedlings were grown at 25 degreesC. ND indicates that no radioactivity was detected.(C)Comparison of the total rootward IAA transport between Col(g) andscd1 1at 18 and 25 degreesC, *p< 0.05.(D)Rootward IAA transport was determined for seedlings grown at constant 18 or 25 degreesC or transitioned from 18 to 25 degreesC for 6 h before assay.(E)Shootward IAA transport was measured in thirty 5 day old seedlings grown at 18 degreesC or 25 degreesC.(F)scd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC were transferred to 25 degreesC for 4, 8, and 24 h prior to the3H IAA transport assay. Significant reduction in IAA transport inscd1 1seedlings as compared to Col(g) is indicated *p< 0.05.(G,H)Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings expressing pDR5 GFP, were grown for 7 days and treated with unlabeled IAA at the root tip. Auxin induced gene expression was reflected in the movement of fluorescence from the root tip toward the shoot in the epidermal tissue at the indicated times after application of IAA at the root tip at(G)18 degreesC and (H) 25 degreesC. Arrowheads indicate the most distal position of epidermal GFP signal. Scale bar = 50 um.\n\nTo determine whether shootward IAA transport, which controls gravity response (Rashotte et al., 2000), was impaired inscd1 1,3H IAA was applied to the root tip of 5 day old wild type andscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 or 25 degreesC. After 2 h, shootward transport was measured. At 18 degreesC, there was no significant difference between wild type andscd1 1in the amount of IAA transported (Figure 3E). At 25 degreesC, wild type roots had a twofold greater shootward auxin transport compared to those grown at 18 degreesC, whilescd1 1showed equivalent levels of IAA transport at 18 and 25 degreesC (Figure 3E). Thus unlike the wild type,scd1 1does not display a temperature dependent increase in auxin transport, and had significantly less transport than Col(g) at 25 degreesC.scd1 1seedlings were grown at 18 degreesC for 5 days then transferred to 25 degreesC, and the amount of shootward3H IAA transport was determined. Within 8 h of transfer there was a significant decrease in IAA transport compared to wild type, with a further decrease by 24 h (Figure 3F).\n\nWild type andscd1 1seedlings expressing the auxin responsive promoter driven reporter (DR5 GFP) were used to follow movement of an auxin induced gene expression signal using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009). Unlabeled IAA was applied to the root tips of wild type andscd1 1seedlings, and the spread of GFP fluorescence in epidermal cells from the root tip toward the shoot was visualized (Figures 3G,H). Before application of IAA, epidermal fluorescence was limited to the root tip (Figure 3G). At 18 degreesC, for up to 4 h after IAA application, a similar steady elongation of the zone of fluorescence along the root tip was observed in wild type andscd1 1seedlings (Figure 3G). However, at 25 degreesC,scd1 1roots showed a significantly slower shootward progression of GFP signal than wild type, and even accumulated a bolus of fluorescence near the root tip, consistent with the ability to take up IAA, but not to transport IAA away from the root tip (Figure 3H). These results are consistent with impaired IAA transport from the root tip at the restrictive temperature leading to reduced growth and gravitropic curvature.\n\nWild type andscd1 1seedlings containing a reporter of auxin induced gene expression in which the auxin responsive DR5 artificial promoter drives GFP synthesis (DR5 GFP) were used to determine whether the altered gravitropic response ofscd1 1was accompanied by a temperature sensitive defect in the lateral redistribution of auxin at the root tip. Seedlings were grown at 18 degreesC for 5 days then were reoriented 90 degrees, and then imaged at 2 h intervals after staining with propidium iodide (PI) to reveal the boundaries of cells. GFP fluorescence was captured in optical slices through the center of the root with settings optimized to visualize the signal in the epidermis on the lower side of the root. At 18 degreesC roots of both genotypes showed asymmetric auxin induced GFP fluorescence signal with the GFP signal moving a greater distance from the tip back on the lower side of roots beginning 4 h after reorientation (Figure 4). At 25 degreesC, the wild type seedlings showed this same asymmetric GFP fluorescence, also beginning at 4 h post reorientation. However, inscd1 1at 25 degreesC, weak asymmetric DR5 GFP fluorescence was not detected until 6 h post re orientation and was substantially less thanscd1 1at 18 degreesC and wild type at either temperature. These data are consistent with reduced asymmetric auxin transport from the root tip affecting the shootward progression of auxin inscd1 1roots reoriented relative to the gravity vector at 25 degreesC, consistent with a role of SCD1 protein in auxin transport dependent processes.\n\nscd1 1shows decreased lateral distribution of auxin at 25 degreesC as compared to wild type. Col(g) andscd1 1pDR5 GFP expressing seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days at 18 or 25 degreesC. After 90 degrees rotation, the asymmetrical pDR5 GFP expression was observed at the root tip at 4, 6, and 8 h after reorientation. The arrows indicate the position farthest from the root tip where asymmetric GFP fluorescence was detected. The seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (magenta) to delineate the cell walls. Representative images from more than 5 roots of each genotype and time point are shown. Scale bar = 50 um.\n\nThe effects of thescd1 1mutation on root development, gravitropism, and IAA transport suggests altered targeting of auxin transport proteins. To test this hypothesis, the distribution ofPIN2pro::PIN2 GFP (PIN2 GFP) fusion protein was examined in wild type andscd1 1seedlings (Figure 5). Wild type seedlings grown at 18 and 25 degreesC, andscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC displayed a typical asymmetric plasma membrane localization of PIN2 GFP at the shootward face of the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells. Thescd1 1seedlings grown at 25 degreesC showed a reduced region of plasma membrane localized PIN2 GFP fluorescence, with expression limited to epidermal cells near the root tip, disappearing at the start of the maturation zone (Figure 5A).scd1 1seedlings grown at 25 degreesC also revealed PIN2 GFP signal in endomembrane bodies, aberrant vesicular compartments in epidermal and cortical cells, similar to those reported previously in response to treatment with chemical that blocks targeting (Drakakaki et al., 2011). The PIN2 GFP endomembrane accumulation was most profound and consistent in the cortical cells in the transition zone (Figure 5B).\n\nPIN2 GFP shows altered localization in the root tips of thescd1 1mutant after constitutive growth or transition to the restrictive temperature.(A)Wild type andscd1 1seedlings were grown at 18 and 25 degreesC. Scale bar = 50 um(B)Higher magnification images of Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings grown for 7 days at 25 degreesC. Scale bar = 20 um.(C)Roots were grown at 18 degreesC for 7 days then transferred to 25 degreesC for the indicated times after transfer. Images representative of more than 100 roots are shown. Scale bar is 20 um.\n\nTo determine the time course of the appearance of the PIN2 GFP containing endomembrane bodies in the root epidermis,scd1 1seedlings were grown at 18 degreesC, shifted to 25 degreesC, and observed continuously for 35 min on a temperature controlled stage at 25 degreesC. Inscd1 1, the PIN2 GFP signal was detected in endomembrane bodies 10 15 min after temperature shift, with an increase in frequency continuing over the next 10 15 min (Figure 5C). In Col(g), PIN2 GFP was rarely detected in endomembrane bodies, although a few are evident at 20 min after transition to 25 degreesC.\n\nPIN1 localizes to the rootward surface of cells in the root vascular cylinder (Galweiler et al., 1998). ThePIN1pro::PIN1 GFP(PIN1 GFP) was also found in endomembrane bodies inscd1 1mutants at 25 degreesC, but not in wild type (Figure 6). However, at 25 degreesC,PIN3pro::PIN3 GFP (PIN3 GFP) was not detected in endomembrane bodies. The localization of ABCB19 and AUX1 fused to fluorescent proteins was not altered inscd1 1(Figure 6). These data suggest that without fully functional SCD1 protein, the membrane targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 auxin transport proteins is disrupted.\n\nPIN1, but not PIN3, ABCB19, or AUX1, was found in endomembrane bodies inscd1 1mutants. Col(g) andscd1 1seedlings expressing PIN1 GFP, PIN3 GFP, ABCB19 GFP (green), and AUX1 YFP (yellow) were grown for 7 days and imaged by LSCM using identical confocal settings after growth at the non permissive temperature of 25 degreesC. Propidium iodide was used to stain the cell wall (magenta). Representative images from at least 5 roots are shown. Scale bar = 10 um.\n\nWe used the endocytic tracer FM4 64 (Bolte et al., 2004) to determine whether the PIN2 containing endomembrane bodies inscd1 1at 25 degreesC were endosomes. Root tips of PIN2 GFPscd1 1were incubated in FM4 64 for 20 min and co localization of the fluorescent signals was quantified over time. Images captured at 60 min after treatment with FM4 64 contain endomembranes that exhibit FM4 64 fluorescence (magenta) or PIN2 GFP fluorescence (green), with the majority of endomembrane bodies containing both fluorescent signals (Figure 7A). These images contrast withscd1 1roots treated with FM4 64 for 20 min, where the endomembrane bodies had either PIN2 GFP fluorescence or FM4 64 signal (Supplementary Figure S3) and with Col(g) root where no PIN2 GFP was visible in endomembranes, and there was no colocalization of FM4 64 and PIN2 GFP signal (Supplementary Figure S4). A threshold function was applied to individual channels to quantify co localization independent of intensity in more than 30 cells from multiple roots at each time point. The thresholded overlay in which pixels were indicated as magenta for FM4 64, green for PIN2 GFP, and white for overlay of FM4 64 and GFP is shown inFigure 7AandSupplementary Figure S3. The percentage of the endomembrane bodies that showed overlapping signals increased steadily over the 60 min time course (Figure 7B), consistent with GFP accumulating in the late endosomes inscd1 1.\n\nColocalization of PIN2 GFP and FM4 64 inscd1 1.(A)Anscd1 1root containing PIN2 GFP (green) incubated in FM4 64 (magenta) for 20 min, rinsed, and imaged after an additional 40 min (a total of 60 min after initiation of staining). Colocalization is indicated in the overlay as white. The merged image was enhanced using a pseudocolor fill of a thresholded image (last panel). Scale bar = 10 um.(B)Roots were stained in FM4 64 for 20 min, transferred to water, and imaged immediately (20 min) or at later times as indicated. The percentage of endomembrane bodies containing GFP, FM4 64, or both signals are plotted as a function of time after initiation of staining with FM4 64. The total number of roots examined was 21. At 20 min:n= 3, at 30 min:n= 5, at 40 min:n= 5, at 50 min:n= 4, at 60 min:n= 4.(C)The time course of colocalization was examined inscd1 1PIN2 GFP roots shifted from 18 to 25 degreesC.scd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC for 7 days were transferred to 5 uM FM4 64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged by confocal microscopy at the indicated intervals on a temperature controlled stage at 25 degreesC. The PIN2 GFP (green) and FM4 64 (magenta) channels are shown separately and in the overlay, where the overlap of both signals is shown in white. Scale bar is 10 um.\n\nTo provide details of the kinetics of this response, the accumulation of FM4 64 and PIN2 GFP was observed over time in root tips ofscd1 1seedlings grown at 18 degreesC for 7 days and placed in FM4 64 for 5 min before transition to 25 degreesC. The formation of PIN2 GFP positive endomembrane bodies was observed within 15 min after transfer to the non permissive temperature and remained at relatively constant levels over a 30 min window (Figure 7C). The frequency and brightness of FM4 64 stained endomembranes increases as the dye moves from early to late endosomes. At 15 min some colocalization of FM4 64 and PIN2 GFP was observed, which increased over time with almost complete overlapping endomembrane signals by 20 min. The non overlapping signals for PIN2 GFP and FM4 64 at early time points and increased colocalization at later time points is consistent with PIN2 GFP accumulation in late endosomes.\n\nTo identify the specific endomembrane compartment in which PIN2 GFP accumulated inscd1 1mutants grown at 25 degreesC, these lines were crossed with plants expressing red or cyan fluorescent protein fusion markers for five distinct endomembrane compartments (Supplementary Table S1). ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPase homologs, found in recycling endosomes (ARA6) (Ebine et al., 2012) or in late endosomes, prevacuolar compartments and the trans Golgi network (ARA7) (Lee et al., 2004;Haas et al., 2007;Jia et al., 2013;Cui et al., 2014;Ito et al., 2018). Whenscd1 1seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP (green) and RFP ARA7 (magenta) were grown at 25 degreesC, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2 GFP signal (green) or RFP ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white) (Figure 8). Higher magnification images of this localization are shown inFigure 9. To determine if PIN2 GFP in endomembrane bodies colocalized with both of these markers inscd1 1mutants we performed a quantitative colocalization analysis examining signal in multiple PIN2 GFP positive endomembranes. The weighted Manders coefficients (Manders et al., 1993) for the colocalization of PIN2 GFP were 0.94 and 0.91 with ARA7 and ARA6, respectively, and Pearson's overlap coefficients (Dunn et al., 2011) were 0.82 and 0.83, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of both RFP ARA7 or ARA6 RFP and PIN2 GFP in a subset of these vesicles is consistent with other cargo proteins that move through a subset of the ARA7 positive endosomes interacting with distinct sets of RAB5 proteins (Dunn et al., 2011;Ito et al., 2018).\n\nPIN2 overlays ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies found in the root tips ofscd1 1mutants at 25 degreesC. RFP ARA7 or ARA6 RFP (magenta) were crossed intoscd1 1containing PIN2 GFP (green) roots and fluorescence visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. Pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence are shown in white. Whenscd1 1seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP and RFP ARA7 were grown at 25 degreesC, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2 GFP signal (green) or RFP ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white). The insets are higher magnifications of the areas delineated by the white boxes above. For each reporter line, more than 20 seedlings were examined. The scale bar is 10 um.\n\nPIN2 co localizes with ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodiesscd1 1mutants at 25 degreesC. Roots ofscd1 1containing ARA7 RFP or ARA6 RFP (magenta) and PIN2 GFP (green) roots were visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. The overlay shows pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence as white. Using colocalization software, thresholds were generated to better illustrate pixels with both fluorescent signals from 4 roots of each line. Colocalization graphs are shown for endomembrane bodies that are circled.\n\nWe found little or no overlap in the endomembrane localization of PIN2 GFP fluorescence in lines containing reporters localized in either the early endosome (VHA1 RFP) (Geldner et al., 2007) TGN (SYP61 CFP) (Robert et al., 2008), or the sorting endosome (SNX1 RFP) (Jaillais et al., 2006,2007;Supplementary Figure S5). These results are consistent with PIN2 GFP inscd1 1accumulating in late multivesicular endosomes and not in other compartments.",
    "discussion": "Polar transport of the hormone auxin from cell to cell is controlled by the asymmetric localization of the PIN family of IAA efflux carriers (Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Zazimalova et al., 2010;Adamowski and Friml, 2015). These carrier proteins are directed to specific plasma membrane domains through dynamically regulated membrane trafficking and recycling pathways (Geldner, 2009;Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). Internal and external environmental cues also affect the localization of the PIN proteins through regulation of the flow of PIN proteins between the endosome and plasma membrane (Paciorek et al., 2005;Jasik et al., 2013,2016;Rakusova et al., 2015), as well as between the plasma membrane and the lytic vacuole (Kleine Vehn et al., 2008a).\n\nIn this study we utilized a temperature sensitivescd1 1mutant to uncover the dynamics of auxin transport targeting and how these reversible changes in protein targeting control auxin transport and dependent process. SCD1 contains a DENN domain found in proteins with RAB directed GEF activity and in proteins that interact with clathrin (Patino Lopez et al., 2008;Sato et al., 2008;McMichael et al., 2013).SCD1null mutants have revealed the function of this protein as a RAB GEF that participates in both endocytosis and exocytosis (Mayers et al., 2017).\n\nThe effects of the temperature sensitivescd1 1mutant on root development was examined at the permissive and restrictive temperatures of 18 and 25 degreesC, respectively. We found thatscd1 1exhibits a suite of phenotypes only at restrictive temperature, which include impaired root elongation and gravity response, reduced lateral root formation, and inhibition of formation of asymmetric auxin induced gene expression across a gravity stimulated root. These phenotypes were also induced when plants were grown at the permissive temperature and then transitioned to the restrictive temperature and could be reversed when plants were transitioned from the restrictive temperature back to the permissive temperature. As all of these phenotypes are dependent on auxin transport, we also measured both shootward and rootward transport and found that both are impaired at the restrictive temperature.\n\nThe ability to reversibly manipulate lateral root development in thescd1 1mutant provided unique insight into how this process is regulated and revealed the critical time point when SCD1 and auxin transport are needed for lateral root development. A temperature switch assay was performed resulting in the shift of seedlings from the permissive temperature to the non permissive temperature or vice versa over 10 days. These data support the hypothesis that SCD1 is needed for lateral root development between days 2 and 6. Transition from the permissive to non permissive temperature also reduces auxin transport inscd1 1(but not Col(g)) showing reductions in the long distance rootward transport within 8 h after transition. A previous report suggested that there is specific regulation of auxin transport in this time window with a pulse of auxin moving from the shoot to the root at 3 5 days, which correlated with the emergence of the first lateral root (Bhalerao et al., 2002). Our ability to reversibly alter auxin transport by turning off or on SCD1 function support the model of an auxin pulse that drives root formation that occurs within a precise developmental window.\n\nThe effects of thescd1 1mutation on auxin transport and gravitropism were evident after both long and short term exposure to the non permissive temperature, with changes in auxin transport evident preceding gravitropic differences. When grown continuously at 25 degreesC or within 8 h after transfer from the permissive 18 degreesC temperature,scd1 1seedlings showed reduced shootward3H IAA transport and accumulation of auxin induced gene expression at the root tip, consistent with impaired auxin transport away from the site of application. Similarly, continuous growth at 25 degreesC or a shift from 18 to 25 degreesC for 8 h showed a significant decrease in the gravitropic curvature inscd1 1compared to wild type. Auxin induced gene expression, visualized via DR5 GFP fluorescence (Muday and Rahman, 2008;Geisler et al., 2014) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired inscd1 1seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25 degreesC. These data support the hypothesis that a functional SCD1 protein is needed to maintain polar and lateral auxin transport and the physiological processes dependent upon dynamic changes in appropriate auxin distribution. Consistent with this model, altered PIN2 GFP trafficking is even more rapidly perturbed inscd1 1than auxin movements and gravity response.\n\nBecause PIN2 is required for rootward transport and root gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998;Rashotte et al., 2000;Chen et al., 2002), we compared its localization in thescd1 1mutant and wild type using a PIN2 GFP reporter. At 25 degreesC, PIN2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings (Muller et al., 1998). In thescd1 1mutant, PIN2 GFP was not restricted to the plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies.Mayers et al. (2017)showed thatscd1 2has altered PIN2 GFP trafficking during treatment with brefeldin A, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans Golgi transport. However, we find that inscd1 1at the restrictive temperature, PIN2 GFP accumulates in the absence of BFA.\n\nThe trafficking defect is not detectable inscd1 1roots grown at 18 degreesC, but when switched from 18 to 25 degreesC, the PIN2 trafficking defect becomes apparent within minutes. Since changes in auxin transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8 12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential and that PIN mislocalization is not a secondary result of compromised root development at 25 degreesC. The linkage is most evident in terms of gravity response. PIN2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998;Rashotte et al., 2000;Chen et al., 2002). Upon transition ofscd1 1to the non permissive temperature, PIN2 GFP endomembrane accumulation is evident with less than hour. In Col(g) a transition from 18 to 25 degreesC increases shootward transport by more than fivefold within 5 h, leading to a more than twofold greater transport in Col(g) than inscd1 1. Treatment of roots for 12 h at the non permissive temperature impaired gravity response inscd1 1to levels consistent with constitutive growth at this non permissive temperature. Together these results support the timeline where PIN2 targeting is impaired, reducing auxin transport and then dependent physiological processes.\n\nWe also detected l PIN1 GFP within endomembrane bodies inscd1 1. However, other fluorescent fusions to the auxin transport proteins PIN3, ABCB19, and AUX1, were not observed in any endomembrane compartments. As all of these proteins are trafficked and recycled, and thescd1 1mutation most strongly affects PIN1 and PIN2 and dependent physiological processes, there appears to be selectivity of SCD1 targets toward PIN2 and PIN1, which is consistent with other studies that reveal distinct regulatory and trafficking machinery between auxin transporters (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014;Weller et al., 2017). Other reports have indicated that ABCB19 and AUX1 localization are regulated by different trafficking mechanisms than those that regulate PIN1 and PIN2 (Kleine Vehn et al., 2006;Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008). The results are based on differences in the trafficking of these proteins in response to brefeldin A and FM4 64 uptake (Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008).\n\nWe find that inscd1 1at 25 degreesC, PIN2 GFP accumulates in the late or multivesicular endosome. Impaired uptake of the endosomal marker dye FM4 64 has previously been observed inscd1 1, suggesting that SCD1 participates in endocytosis via clathrin coated vesicles (McMichael et al., 2013). To determine whether FM4 64 accumulates in the PIN2 endomembrane bodies observed here, the roots ofscd1 1containing PIN2 GFP grown at 18 degreesC and transferred to 25 degreesC were treated with FM4 64. Although initially there was little co localization, within 20 min significant overlap was observed. These results are consistent with PIN2 being trapped inscd1mutants in a late or multivesicular endosome or pre vacuolar compartment on its way to or from the plasma membrane through the endosome.\n\nTo confirm that the endomembranes in which PIN2 GFP accumulates inscd1 1are late endosomes, we crossed multiple endosomal markers into this mutant and performed colocalization analyses. Inscd1 1at 25 degreesC, but not 18 degreesC, we observed PIN2 GFP colocalization with ARA7 and to a lesser extent with ARA6. ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPases contained in late multivesicular endosomes, with related, but not identical trafficking activities (Ueda et al., 2004;Beck et al., 2012;Ebine et al., 2012;Paez Valencia et al., 2016). ARA7 function is required for vesicle transport between the pre vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (Lee et al., 2004;Haas et al., 2007;Jia et al., 2013) and ARA6 is associated with transport between the PVC and the plasma membrane, where it may regulate trafficking from the endosome to the plasma membrane (Ebine et al., 2011,2012). PIN2 has also been localized to ARA7 vesicles inArabidopsisroots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking (Li et al., 2017).\n\nThe colocalization of PIN2 with both ARA7 and ARA6 Rab related GTPases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ARA7 and ARA6 have been previously shown to partially overlap, despite evidence that they are distinct endosomal compartments (Ueda et al., 2004;Beck et al., 2012;Ebine et al., 2012). The PVC, where both ARA6 and ARA7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants that facilitates the transport of materials from the endosomes to the vacuole (Contento and Bassham, 2012). Using immunogold and confocal microscopy, plasma membrane proteins that pass through the PVC have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation (Haas et al., 2007;Viotti et al., 2010). Thus, association of PIN2 with the PVC inscd1 1suggests that PIN2 in the PVC is likely targeted to the vacuole for degradation. This could explain the reduced domain of PIN2 GFP staining seen in the mutants at the restrictive temperature, coincident with the changes in columella cells. However, there is also evidence that suggests that PIN2 can be retrieved from the PVC and recycled (Kleine Vehn et al., 2008b;Spitzer et al., 2009). Indeed, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are targeted to the vacuole through the multi vesicular body (MVB), and RabF2A co localizes in the MVB with PIN1 GFP (Spitzer et al., 2009).\n\nThe localization of PIN2 GFP in late endosomal compartments inscd1 1is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions (Paciorek et al., 2005;Kleine Vehn et al., 2008b;Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Jasik et al., 2013). For example, when roots are reoriented relative to the gravity vector, enhanced endocytosis of PIN2 at the apical membrane followed by degradation through sorting to a proteolytic endosomal compartment resulted in asymmetric distribution of PIN2, redirected auxin flow, and root bending (Abas et al., 2006). The mis localization and loss of membrane PIN2 inscd1 1explains the observed reductions in auxin transport and the observed phenotypes.\n\nThe efficient targeting of auxin transport proteins to the plasma membrane is required for appropriate auxin transport and dependent physiological processes. In this paper we have shown that the conditionalscd1 1mutant, with a defect in a gene that functions as a RAB GEF (Mayers et al., 2017), has altered localization of PIN2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. The PIN2 GFP containing endomembrane bodies inscd1 1showed dye accumulation and fluorescent protein reporter expression consistent with a late endosomal/prevacuolar character. Consistent with this altered protein localization, polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired inscd1 1. The kinetics of the alterations in these responses upon transition to the non permissive temperature demonstrate that altered trafficking of PIN2 is observed within minutes of transition to this temperature, while auxin transport and gravity defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects can be quantified days after transition. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts PIN2 protein localization precedes reductions in auxin transport and changes in auxin transport dependent physiological processes.",
